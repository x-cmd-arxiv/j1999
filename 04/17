The range is not well known,\nbut solar to a few times solar appears to be typical. There is also evidence\nfor higher metallicities in more luminous objects, and for generally enhanced\nN/C and Fe/alpha abundances compared to solar ratios.\n  These results identify QSOs with vigorous, high-redshift star formation --\nconsistent with the early evolution of massive galactic nuclei or dense\nproto-galactic clumps.

For example, 1)\nmost of the enrichment and star formation must occur before the QSOs \"turn on\"\nor become observable, on time scales of ~<1 Gyr at least at the highest\nredshifts. 2) The tentative result for enhanced Fe/alpha suggests that the\nfirst local star formation began at least ~1 Gyr prior to the QSO epoch. 3) The\nstar formation must ultimately be extensive in order to reach high\nmetallicities, i.e. a substantial fraction of the local gas must be converted\ninto stars and stellar remnants. The exact fraction depends on the shape of the\ninitial mass function (IMF). 4) The highest derived metallicities require IMFs\nthat are weighted slightly more toward massive stars than the in solar\nneighborhood. 5) High metallicities also require deep gravitational potentials.\nBy analogy with the well-known mass--metallicity relation among low-redshift\ngalaxies, metal-rich QSOs should reside in galaxies (or proto-galaxies) that\nare minimally as massive (or as tightly bound) as our own Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 1999 01:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
