That is the starting\npoint because it is the only starting point that requires no cause, no\nexplanation nor justification of its existence.\n  But, that starting point has two impediments to the universe, or anything,\ncoming into existence from it. First is the problem of change from nothing to\nsomething without, at least initially, an infinite rate of change, which is\nimpossible. Second is the problem of change from nothing to something without\nviolating conservation, which must be maintained.\n  Mathematical analysis develops the sole solution to both problems. That is\nthat the beginning had to be of a +/-[1 - cosine] form. That solution indicates\nthe fundamental nature of matter, energy and field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 1999 18:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 20:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2005 22:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 19:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
