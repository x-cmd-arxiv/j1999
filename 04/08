By comparing the HI\ndata with IRAS data, we have derived the distributions of I_100 excess and\ntau_100 excess, which are respectively the 100 mum intensity and 100 mum\noptical depth in excess of what would be expected from HI emission. In two\nobserved regions, we were able to make a detailed comparison of the infrared\nexcess and the CO emission. We have found that tau_100 excess has a very good\ncorrelation with the integrated intensity of CO emission, W_CO, but I_100\nexcess does not. There are two reasons for the poor correlation between I_100\nexcess and W_CO: firstly, there are regions with enhanced infrared emissivity\nwithout CO, and secondly, dust grains associated with molecular gas have a low\ninfrared emissivity. In one region, these two factors completely hide the\npresence of molecular gas in the infrared. In the second region, we could\nidentify the area with molecular gas, but I_100 excess significantly\nunderestimates the column density of molecular hydrogen because of the second\nfactor mentioned above. We therefore conclude that tau_100 excess, rather than\nI_100 excess, is an accurate indicator of molecular content along the line of\nsight.

Since the non-trivial scaling is a sign of a strong\nnon-linearity of the problem, these two results seem to contradict each other.\nA theory, explaining this result is presented in this paper. Strong\ntime-dependence of the large-scale features of the flow ($\\bar{u^2}\\propto t$)\nresults in decoupling of the large-scale dynamics from statistically\nsteady-state small-scale random processes. This time-dependence is also a\nreason for the localness of the pressure-gradient terms in the equations\ngoverning the small-scale velocity difference PDF's. The derived\nself-consistent expression for the pressure gradient contributions lead to the\nconclusion that the small-scale transverse velocity differences are governed by\na linear Langevin-like equation, strirred by a non-local, universal,\nsolution-depending gaussian random force. This explains the experimentally\nobserved gaussian statistics of transverse velocity differences and their\nKolmogorov scaling. The solution for the PDF of longitudinal velocity\ndifferences is based on a smallness of the energy flux in two-dimensional\nturbulence. The theory makes a few quantitative predictions which can be tested\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 1999 16:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 1999 20:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We find that there is a threshold in synaptic strength, $\\tau_c$,\nbelow which there are no stable spiking network states. Above threshold the\nstable spiking state is a cluster state, where different groups of neurons fire\nconsecutively, and each neuron fires with the same cluster each time. Weak\nnoise destabilizes this state, but stronger noise drives the system into a\ndifferent, self-organized, stochastically synchronized state. Neuronal firing\nis still organized in clusters, but individual neurons can hop from cluster to\ncluster. Noise can actually induce and sustain such a state below the threshold\nof synaptic strength.

This effect has been known for a long time, and has recently been called\n``squashing'' [B.C. Buchler et al., Optics Letters {\\bf 24}, 259 (1999)], as\nopposed to the ``squeezing'' of a free field in which the conjugate\nfluctuations are increased. In this paper I present a general theory of\nsquashing, including simultaneous squashing of both quadratures and\nsimultaneous squeezing and squashing. I show that a two-level atom coupled to\nthe in-loop light feels the effect of the fluctuations as calculated by the\ntheory. In the ideal limit of light squeezed in one quadrature and squashed in\nthe other, the atomic decay can be completely suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1999 00:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A Stern-Gerlach apparatus is used to\nmeasure (4s+1) expectations of projection operators on appropriate coherent\nstates in the unknown state. These measurements are compatible with a finite\nnumber of states which can be distinguished, in the generic case, by measuring\none more probability. In addition, the present technique shows that the zeroes\nof a Husimi distribution do have an operational meaning: they can be identified\ndirectly by measurements with a Stern-Gerlach apparatus. This result comes down\nto saying that it is possible to resolve experimentally structures in quantum\nphase-space which are smaller than hbar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1999 13:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
