In the theory, a highly relativistic shell interacts with the\ninterstellar medium through the filamentation and the two-stream instabilities\nto convert bulk kinetic energy into electron thermal energy and magnetic field\nenergy. The processes are not efficient enough to satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot\nconditions, so a shock cannot form through this mechanism. Instead, the\ninterstellar medium passes through the shell, with the electrons radiating\nduring this passage. Gamma-rays are produced by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. Prompt optical emission is also produced through this mechanism,\nwhile prompt radio emission is produced through synchrotron emission. The model\ntimescales are consistent with the shortest burst timescales. To emit\ngamma-rays, the shell's bulk Lorentz factor must be greater than approximately\n1000. For the radiative processes to be efficient, the interstellar medium\ndensity must satisfy a lower limit that is a function of the bulk Lorentz\nfactor. Because the limits operate as selection effects, bursts that violate\nthem constitute new classes. In particular, a class of optical and ultraviolet\nbursts with no gamma-ray emission should exist. The lower limit on the density\nof the interstellar medium is consistent with the requirements of the Compton\nattenuation theory, providing an explanation for why all burst spectra appear\nto be attenuated.

Under a weak\nmagnetic field $(\\omega_c\\lsim\\omega_0, \\omega_c$ being a cyclotron frequency)\nand at low temperature $(T\\lsim\\hbar\\omega_0)$, where the orbital magnetic\nmoment fluctuates as a function of the field, the currents are irregularly\ndistributed paramagnetically or diamagnetically inside the bulk region.

It is a double counterpart of\nthe notion of a regular nilpotent element. A pair (e_1,e_2) of commuting\nnilpotent elements is called a pn-pair, if the dimension of their simultaneous\ncentralizer is equal to the rank of {\\frak g} and some bi-homogeneity condition\nis satisfied. Ginzburg proved that many familiar results of the `ordinary'\ntheory have analogues for pn-pairs. The aim of this article is to develop the\ntheory of nilpotent pairs a bit further and to present some applications of it\nto dual pairs and sheets. It is shown that a large portion of Ginzburg's theory\ncan be extended to the pairs whose simultaneous centraliser is of dimension\nrk{\\frak g}+1. Such pairs are called almost pn-pairs. It is worth noting that\nthe very existence of almost pn-pairs is a purely \"double\" phenomenon, because\nthe dimension of \"ordinary\" orbits is always even. We prove that to any\nprincipal or almost nilpotent pair one naturally associates a dual pair.\nMoreover, this dual pair is reductive if and only if e_1 and e_2 can be\nincluded in commuting sl_2-triples. We also study sheets containing members of\npn-pairs. Some cases are described, where these sheets are smooth and admit a\nsection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 1999 13:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-10"}

To\nobtain a wider spectrum of point sets, we consider, more generally, a Riemann\nsurface S immersed in C^2 and its sections (``cuts'') by C. We give S a\ncrystallographic isometry in C^2 by defining a fundamental surface element as a\nconformal map of triangular domains and S as its extension by reflections in\nthe triangle edges. Our main result concerns the special case of maps of right\ntriangles, with the right angle being a regular point of the map. For this\nclass of maps we show that only seven Riemann surfaces, when cut, form point\nsets that are discrete in C. Their isometry groups all have a rank-four lattice\nsubgroup, but only three of the corresponding point sets are doubly periodic in\nC. The remaining surfaces form quasiperiodic point sets closely related to the\nvertex sets of quasiperiodic tilings. In fact, vertex sets of familiar tilings\nare recovered in all cases by applying the construction to a piecewise flat\napproximation of the corresponding Riemann surface. The geometry of point sets\nformed by cuts of Riemann surfaces is no less ``rigid'' than the geometry\ndetermined by a tiling, and has the distinct advantage in having a regular\nbehavior with respect to the complex parameter which specifies the cut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 1999 15:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
