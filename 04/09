Here we report detailed analyses of\nthe ~580 Hz brightness oscillations during bursts from 4U 1636-536. We\ninvestigate the bursts as a whole and, in more detail, the initial portions of\nthe bursts. We analyze the ~580 Hz oscillations in the initial 0.75 seconds of\nthe five bursts that were used in a previous search for a brightness\noscillation at the expected ~290 Hz spin frequency, and find that if the same\nfrequency model describes all five bursts there is insufficient data to require\nmore than a constant frequency or, possibly, a frequency plus a frequency\nderivative. Therefore, although it is appropriate to use an arbitrarily\ncomplicated model of the ~580 Hz oscillations to generate a candidate waveform\nfor the ~290 Hz oscillations, models with more than two parameters are not\nrequired by the data. For the bursts as a whole we show that the\ncharacteristics of the brightness oscillations vary greatly from burst to\nburst. We find, however, that in at least one of the bursts, and possibly in\nthree of the four that have strong brightness oscillations throughout the\nburst, the oscillation frequency reaches a maximum several seconds into the\nburst and then decreases. This behavior has not been reported previously for\nburst brightness oscillations, and it poses a challenge to the standard burning\nlayer expansion explanation for the frequency changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1999 19:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We determined oxygen abundances from spectral synthesis of\nthe stronger line (6300 A) of the [O I] doublet.\n  The syntheses of the [O I] line lead to smaller values of [O/Fe], consistent\nwith those found earlier among halo field and globular cluster giants.

Quantum cryptography is a new\ntechnique for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions:\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither\nsuccessfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping\nraises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed\nexperimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of\nnon-orthogonal photon states to generate shared key material over\nmulti-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both\ncases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per\nbit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset\nof this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data\nreconciliation stage with the sender. Here we report the most recent results of\nour optical fiber experiment in which we have performed quantum key\ndistribution over a 48-km optical fiber network at Los Alamos using photon\ninterference states with the B92 and BB84 quantum key distribution protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1999 22:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
