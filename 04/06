An analysis of these structures\nshows the neutral gas to contain a number of expanding HI holes. The formation\nof the HI holes has been attributed to multiple supernova events occurring\nwithin wind-blown shells around young, massive star clusters, with as many as\n10-200 supernovae required to produce many of the holes. From the sizes and\nexpansion velocities of the holes, Puche et al. assigned ages of ~10^7 to 10^8\nyears. If the supernova scenario for the formation of the HI holes is correct,\nit implies the existence of star clusters with a substantial population of\nlate-B, A and F main sequence stars at the centers of the holes. Many of these\nclusters should be detectable in deep ground-based CCD images of the galaxy. In\norder to test the supernova hypothesis for the formation of the HI holes, we\nhave obtained and analyzed deep broad-band BVR and narrow-band H-alpha images\nof Ho II.

Multiple scale graphs form a unifying conceptual\nframework for the study of evolving graphs. Moreover, small-world behavior in\nrandomly rewired graphs is a consequence of features common to all multiple\nscale graphs. To support the multiple length scale hypothesis, novel graph\narchitectures are introduced that need not be a result of random rewiring of a\nregular graph.

Although the\nphysics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED,\nspecific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics\ncontrolling the details of the refractive index.

It is\nshown that the sub-Poissonian statistics can be enhanced, under certain\ncircumstances, by absorption, which damps out some destructive interferences.\nFurther, it is shown that both the photon-number correlation and the\ncorrelation of the photon-number variance between different pulse components\ncan be highly nonclassical even for an absorbing fiber. Optimum frequency\nwindows are determined in order to realize strong nonclassical behavior, which\noffers novel possibilities of using solitons in optical fibers as a source of\nnonclassically correlated light beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 1999 15:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 1999 19:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
