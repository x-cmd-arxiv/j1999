Abundance gradients are steepest in\nnormal spirals and are seen to be progressively flatter going in order from\nbarred spirals, lenticulars, and ellipticals. For spiral galaxies, local\nmetallicity appears to be correlated with total (disk plus bulge) surface\ndensity. Observed abundance patterns indicate that N production is dominated by\nprimary processes at low metallicity and secondary processes at high\nmetallicity; C production increases with increasing metallicity; and O, Ne, S,\nand Ar are produced in lockstep independent of metallicity. In elliptical\ngalaxies, nuclear abundances are in the range [Z/H] = 0.0 to 0.4, but the\nelement mixture is not scaled-solar. In large elliptical galaxies [Mg/Fe] is in\nthe range 0.3 to 0.5, decreasing to ~0 in smaller elliptical galaxies. Other\nlight elements track the Mg enhancement, but the heavier Ca tracks Fe.

The main point of emphasis of the present note\nis that the transition from 1d to 2d has an underlying quantum group symmetry.\nThis relationhip of 1d to 2d transition with quantum group symmetry ties in\nnicely with our previous proposal to model superconductivity,\nantiferromagnetism and related phases arising from strongly correlated electron\nstates with quantum groups. A simple model based on two interacting chains with\nnearest neighbor and next to nearest neighbor interactions is suggested.\n  It appears reasonable to assume that it is the interaction between the 1d\nLuttinger liquids which leads to the quantum group symmetry and the transition\nto 2d quantum liquid. The conditions under which this 2d quantum liquid\ndeviates away from the 2d Fermi liquid is clearly of main interest to us. One\nof the prime motivations underlying our proposal is the experimental\nobservation of stripe structure [phase] in high T_c superconductivity [HTSC]\nmaterials.

We\nstart with a hadronic meson-baryon Lagrangian that is consistent with chiral\nsymmetry. This is used to obtain a light front version of a one-boson-exchange\nnucleon-nucleon potential (OBEP). The accuracy of our description of the\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) data is good, and similar to that of other relativistic\nOBEP models. We derive, within the light front formalism, the Hartree-Fock and\nBrueckner Hartree-Fock equations. Applying our light front OBEP, the nuclear\nmatter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced. We obtain a value\nof the compressibility, 180 MeV, that is smaller than that of alternative\nrelativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually\ncomes out too large. Because the derivation starts from a meson-baryon\nLagrangian, we are able to show that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by\na NN interaction is a consistent approximation, and the formalism allows one to\ncalculate corrections to this approximation in a well-organized manner. The\nsimplicity of the vacuum in our light front approach is an important feature in\nallowing the derivations to proceed.
