We consider the limits of these models on a\nfine grid in the plane, as the mesh goes to zero. Although the existence of\nscaling limits is still unproven, subsequential scaling limits can be defined\nin various ways, and do exist. We establish some basic a.s. properties of the\nsubsequential scaling limits in the plane. It is proved that any LERW\nsubsequential scaling limit is a simple path, and that the trunk of any UST\nsubsequential scaling limit is a topological tree, which is dense in the plane.\n  The scaling limits of these processes are conjectured to be conformally\ninvariant in 2 dimensions. We make a precise statement of the conformal\ninvariance conjecture for the LERW, and show that this conjecture implies an\nexplicit construction of the scaling limit, as follows. Consider the Loewner\ndifferential equation\n  ${\\partial f\\over\\partial t}\n  = z {\\zeta(t)+z \\over \\zeta(t)-z} {\\partial f\\over\\partial z}$\n  with boundary values $f(z,0)=z$, in the range $z\\in\\U=\\{w\\in\\C\\st |w|<1\\}$,\n$t\\le 0$. We choose $\\zeta(t):= \\B(-2t)$, where $\\B(t)$ is Brownian motion on\n$\\partial \\U$ starting at a random-uniform point in $\\partial \\U$. Assuming the\nconformal invariance of the LERW scaling limit in the plane, we prove that the\nscaling limit of LERW from 0 to $\\partial\\U$ has the same law as that of the\npath $f(\\zeta(t),t)$. We believe that a variation of this process gives the\nscaling limit of the boundary of macroscopic critical percolation clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 1999 09:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 1999 07:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
