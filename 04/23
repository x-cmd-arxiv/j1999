Spectral coverage of 3700-6700A was achieved spanning\ntwo orbits of the binary. The strongest emission lines are HeII 4686A and\nCIII/NIII 4640A (Bowen blend). Other weak emission lines of HeII and CIV are\npresent and Balmer lines show a complex structure, possibly contaminated by\nHeII. HeII 4686A and CIII/NIII 4640A show different orbital light curves\nindicating an origin in different regions. HeII 4686A profiles show a complex\nmultiple S-wave structure. Doppler tomography reveals this emission is not\nassociated with the companion star, and occurs at velocities too low for\nKeplerian disk material. It can possibly be associated with overflowing or\nsplashing stream material. The optical spectrum approximates a steep blue\npower-law, consistent with emission on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a black body\nspectrum. Orbital modulations show no wavelength dependence; this is as\nexpected if both disk and companion star are hot enough for the peak of their\nspectral energy distributions to be in the UV. The hot continuum and presence\nof high-excitation emission lines indicate strong X-ray heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 1999 10:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For such\nsmall energies, the variation of the dipole matrix element is substantial and\ndescribed by the energy scale Ed. Without the coupling to the photoelectron,\nthe corresponding ratio r0(omega) is determined by Ed and the satellite\nexcitation energy dE. When the interaction potential with the continuum states\nis introduced, a new energy scale Es=1/(2Rs^2) enters, where Rs is a length\nscale of the interaction potential. At threshold there is typically a (weak)\nconstructive interference between intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, and\nthe ratio r(omega)/r0(omega) is larger than its limiting value for large omega.\nThe interference becomes small or weakly destructive for photoelectron energies\nof the order Es. For larger energies r(omega)/r0(omega) therefore typically has\na weak undershoot. If this undershoot is neglected, r(omega)/r0(omega) reaches\nits limiting value on the energy scale Es.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 1999 09:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
