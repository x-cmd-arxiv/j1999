The most prominent\nnon-Gaussian features are massive haloes, visible as clusters of galaxies. The\ndistortion of high-redshift galaxy images due to the tidal gravitational field\nof the large-scale matter distribution, called cosmic shear, can be used to\ninvestigate the statistical properties of the LSS. In particular, non-Gaussian\nproperties of the LSS will lead to a non-Gaussian distribution of cosmic-shear\nstatistics. The aperture mass ($M_{\\rm ap}$) statistics, recently introduced as\na measure for cosmic shear, is particularly well suited for measuring these\nnon-Gaussian properties. In this paper we calculate the highly non-Gaussian\ntail of the aperture mass probability distribution, assuming Press-Schechter\ntheory for the halo abundance and the `universal' density profile of haloes as\nobtained from numerical simulations. We find that for values of $M_{\\rm ap}$\nmuch larger than its dispersion, this probability distribution is closely\napproximated by an exponential, rather than a Gaussian. We determine the\namplitude and shape of this exponential for various cosmological models and\naperture sizes, and show that wide-field imaging surveys can be used to\ndistinguish between some of the currently most popular cosmogonies.
