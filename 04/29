The origin of Hawking radiation is\nclosely related to the fact that a particle which marginally escapes from\ncollapsing into a black hole is observed at the future infinity with infinitely\nlarge redshift. In other words, such a particle had a very high frequency when\nit was near the event horizon. Motivated by the possibility that the property\nof Hawking radiation may be altered by some unknowned physics which may exist\nbeyond some critical scale, Unruh proposed a model which has higher order\nspatial derivative terms. In his model, the effects of unknown physics are\nmodeled so as to be suppressed for the waves with a wavelength much longer than\nthe critical scale, $k_0^{-1}$. Surprisingly, it was shown that the thermal\nspectrum is recovered for such modified models. To introduce such higher order\nspatial derivative terms, the Lorentz invariance must be violated because one\nspecial spatial direction needs to be chosen. In previous works, the rest frame\nof freely-falling observers was employed as this special reference frame. Here\nwe give an extension by allowing a more general choice of the reference frame.\nDeveloping the method taken by Corley, % and especially focusing on subluminal\ncase, we show that the resulting spectrum of created particles again becomes\nthe thermal one at the Hawking temperature even if the choice of the reference\nframe is generalized.
