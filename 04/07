It is seen in the 12CO(J=1-0),\n12CO(J=2-1), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0) lines. The superbubble is centred\naround the most powerful supernova remnant in M82, 41.9+58. The CO observations\nshow that the molecular superbubble already broke out of the disk. This\nscenario is supported by ROSAT HRI observations which suggest that hot coronal\ngas originating from inside the shell is the main contributor to the diffuse\nX-ray outflow in M82. We briefly discuss observations of the same region at\nother wavelengths (radio continuum, optical, HI, X-rays, ionized gas). From our\nspectral line observations, we derive a kinematic age of about 10^6 years for\nthe superbubble. Using simple theoretical models, the total energy needed for\nthe creation of this superbubble is of order 2*10^{54} ergs. The required\nenergy input rate (0.001 SN yr^{-1}) is reasonable given the high supernova\n(SN) rate of ~0.1 SN yr^{-1} in the central part of M82. As much as 10% of the\nenergy needed to create the superbubble is still present in form of the kinetic\nenergy of the expanding molecular shell. Of order 10% is conserved in the hot\nX-ray emitting gas emerging from the superbubble into the halo of M82. This\nnewly detected expanding molecular superbubble is believed to be powered by the\nsame objects that also lie at the origin of the prominent X-ray outflow in M82.\nIt can therefore be used as an alternative tool to investigate the physical\nproperties of these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 1999 12:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such dependence takes the form \\lambda^{-1}\\propto E^n in a wide class of\ntheoretical models, including ``standard'' oscillations due to neutrino mass\nand mixing (n=-1), energy-independent oscillations (n=0), and violations of the\nequivalence principle or of Lorentz invariance (n=1). We study first how the\ntheoretical zenith distributions of sub-GeV, multi-GeV, and upward-going muon\nevents change for different integer values of n. Then we perform a detailed\nanalysis of the Super-Kamiokande data by treating the energy exponent n as a\nfree parameter, with unconstrained scale factors for both the amplitude and the\nphase of nu_mu<--->nu_tau oscillations. We find a best-fit range n=-0.9 \\pm 0.4\nat 90% C.L., which confirms the standard scenario (n=-1) as the dominant\noscillation mechanism, and strongly constrains possible concurrent exotic\nprocesses (n \\neq -1). In particular, we work out the interesting case of\nleading standard oscillations plus subleading terms induced by violations of\nspecial or general relativity principles, and obtain extremely stringent upper\nbounds on the amplitude of such violations in the (nu_mu,nu_tau) sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 1999 16:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}

A richer dynamics is unveiled when the extended character\nof the soliton is taken into account. We show that interesting spatiotemporal\nphenomena appear when the structure of the soliton interacts with finite-width\ninhomogeneities. We solve an inverse problem in order to have external\nperturbations which are generic and topologically equivalent to well-known\nbifurcation models and such that the stability problem can be solved exactly.\nWe also show the different quasiperiodic and chaotic motions the soliton\nundergoes as a time-dependent force pumps energy into the traslational mode of\nthe kink and relate these dynamics with the excitation of the shape modes of\nthe soliton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 1999 23:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

It is shown\nthat the disintegration time is close to its minimum value equal to the shock\nthickness divided by a relative velocity of the emerging secondary structures.\nThe secondary TASW that appears after the disintegration is again unstable with\nrespect to disintegration. When the perturbation has a cyclic nature, the TASW\nundergoes oscillatory disintegration, during which it repeatedly transforms\ninto another TASW.
