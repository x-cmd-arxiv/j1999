We propose launching the Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS), a\nlarge steerable occulting satellite to combine both of these techniques. BOSS\nwill have several advantages over standard occulting bodies. BOSS would block\nall but about 4e-5 of the light at 1 micron in the region of interest around\nthe star for planet detections. Because the occultation occurs outside the\ntelescope, scattering inside the telescope does not degrade this performance.\nBOSS could be combined with a space telescope at the Earth-Sun L2 point to\nyield very long integration times, in excess of 3000 seconds. If placed in\nEarth orbit, integration times of 160--1600 seconds can be achieved from most\nmajor telescope sites for objects in over 90% of the sky. Applications for BOSS\ninclude direct imaging of planets around nearby stars. Planets separated by as\nlittle as 0.1--0.25 arcseconds from the star they orbit could be seen down to a\nrelative intensity as little as 1e-9 around a magnitude 8 (or brighter) star.\nOther applications include ultra-high resolution imaging of compound sources,\nsuch as microlensed stars and quasars, down to a resolution as little as 0.1\nmilliarcseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 1999 17:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We discuss several different exchange models which may be\nrelevant for this compound, namely in- line and zig-zag chain models with weak\nas well as strong inter- chain coupling and also a ladder model and a CO/MV\n(mixed valent) model. We put special emphasis on the importance of large\nadditional exchange across the diagonals of V- ladders and the presence of\nexchange anisotropies on the excitation spectrum. It is shown that the observed\nsplitting of transverse dispersion branches may both be interpreted as\nanisotropy effect as well as acoustic- optic mode splitting in the weakly\ncoupled chain models. In addition we calculate the field dependence of\nexcitation modes in these models. Furthermore we show that for strong inter-\nchain coupling, as suggested by recent LDA+U results, an additional high energy\noptical excitation appears and the spin gap is determined by anisotropies. The\nmost promising CO/MV model predicts a spin wave dispersion perpendicular to the\nchains which agrees very well with recent results obtained by inelastic neutron\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 1999 13:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 1999 17:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Firstly, we express the normalized\nvolume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3,\nobtaining thereby \"Bures prior probability distributions\" over the two- and\nthree-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these\nresults to n > 3, we determine that the \"Hall normalization constant\" (C_{n})\nfor the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the\n(n-1)-dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices\nis, for n = 4, equal to 71680/pi^2. Since we also find that C_{3} = 35/pi, it\nfollows that C_{4} is simply equal to 2^{11} C_{3}/pi. (C_{2} itself is known\nto equal 2/pi.) The constant C_{5} is also found. It too is associated with a\nremarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive\nprime numbers from 2 to 23.\n  We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n > 5, with the use of\nquasi-Monte Carlo integration.
