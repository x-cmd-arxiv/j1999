The results of this analysis yield insights into\nthe mode structure of semiregular variables and help to clarify the\nrelationship between them and Mira variables. After collecting all available\ndata from various international databases (AFOEV, VSOLJ, HAA/VSS and AAVSO) we\ntest the accuracy and reliability of data. We compare the averaged and\nnoise-filtered visual light curves with simultaneous photoelectric\nV-measurements, the effect of the length versus the relatively low\nsignal-to-noise ratio is illustrated by period analysis of artificial data,\nwhile binning effects are tested by comparing results of frequency analyses of\nthe unbinned and averaged light curves.\n  The distribution of periods and period ratios is examined through the use of\nthe (log P_0, log P_1) and (log P_1, log P_0/P_1) plots. Three significant and\ntwo less obvious sequences are present which could be explained as the direct\nconsequence of different pulsational modes. This hypothesis is supported by the\nresults for multiperiodic variables with three periods. Finally, these space\nmethods are illustrated by several interesting case studies that show the best\nexamples of different special phenomena such as long-term amplitude modulation,\namplitude decrease and mode switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 1999 20:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At very low temperatures $T$, or farther from the\ncritical point, a crossover occurs to a \"quantum\" transport regime dominated by\nvariable range hopping.
