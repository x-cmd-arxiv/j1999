Each H=H_{0}+eH', with H_{0} integrable and\neH' a nonintegrable correction, not necessarily small. For e below a critical\ne_{0} escapes are impossible energetically. For somewhat higher values, escape\nis allowed energetically but many orbits never escape and the escape\nprobability P for a generic orbit ensemble decays exponentially. At or near a\ncritical e_{1}>e_{0}, there is an abrupt qualitative change in behaviour. Above\ne_{1}, P typically exhibits (1) a rapid evolution towards a nonzero P_{0}(e)\nfollowed by (2) a much slower subsequent decay towards zero which, in at least\none case, is well fit by a power law P=const x t^{m}, with m=0.35-0.40. In all\nthree cases, P_{0} and the time T required to converge towards P_{0} scales in\ne-e_{1}, i.e., P_{0}=const x (e-e_{1})^{a} and T=const x (e-e_{1})^{b}, and T\nalso scales in the size r of the region sampled for initial conditions, i.e.,\nT=const x r^{-d}. To within statistical uncertainties, the best fit values of\nthe critical exponents are the same for all three potentials, namely: a=0.5,\nb=0.4, and d=0.1, and satisfy a-b-d=0. The transitional behaviour observed near\ne_{1} is attributed to the breakdown of some especially significant KAM tori or\ncantori. The power law behaviour at late times is interpreted as reflecting\nintrinsic diffusion of chaotic orbits through cantori surrounding islands of\nregular orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 1999 16:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

There is a tentative trend\nfor supernova with smaller envelopes showing more polarization, with Type Ic\nhaving the smallest envelopes and showing the largest polarization. The recent\ndiscovery of the unusual supernova SN 1998bw and its apparent correlation with\nthe gamma-ray burst GRB~980425 has raised new issues concerning both the\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. SN 1998bw resembled a Type Ic, but was\nunusually bright at maximum light in the optical and radio, and its expansion\nvelocities were large. This makes SN 1998bw a possible candidate for a\n\"hypernova\" with explosion energies exceeding 10^52 erg. We show that the light\ncurve of SN 1998bw can be understood as the result of viewing an aspherical\nexplosion roughly along the symmetry axis of an exploding, non-degenerate C/O\ncore of a massive star with a kinetic energy of 2x10^51 erg, a total ejecta\nmass of 2 solar masses, and a nickel-56 mass of 0.2 solar masses. In this\nmodel, the high expansion velocities are a direct consequence of the aspherical\nexplosion which, in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours and that\naccounts for the polarization. It is not yet clear how either the hypernovae or\nthese asymmetric models can produce gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 1999 16:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This draped field is further stretched by\nthe wind flow into a long, thin filament whose aspect ratio is determined by\nthe balance between the dynamical wind and amplified magnetic field pressures.\nThe key feature of this cometary model is that the filaments are dynamic\nconfigurations, and not static structures. As such, they are local\namplifications of an otherwise weak field and not directly connected to any\nstatic global field.
