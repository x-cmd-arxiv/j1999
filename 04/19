We propose an experimental photodetection\nscheme to probe nonlocal quantum correlations exhibited by this state.\nFurthermore, we show that the correlation functions measured in two versions of\nthe experiment are given directly by the Wigner function and the Q function of\nthe EPR state. Thus, the measurement of these two quasidistribution functions\nyields a novel scheme for testing quantum nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 1999 09:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
