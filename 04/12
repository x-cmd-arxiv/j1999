We compare the H I observations to\nl-V diagrams synthesized from 2-D fluid dynamical simulations of gas flows in a\nfamily of barred potentials. The gas flow pattern is very sensitive to the\nparameters of the assumed potential, which allows us to discriminate among\nmodels. We present a model that reproduces the outer contour of the H I l-V\ndiagram reasonably well; this model has a strong bar with a semimajor axis of\n3.6 kpc, an axis ratio of approximately 3:1, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR),\nand a pattern speed of 42 km/s/kpc, and matches the data best when viewed from\n34\\deg to the bar major axis. The behavior of the models, combined with the\nconstraint that the shocks in the Milky Way bar should resemble those in\nexternal barred galaxies, leads us to conclude that wide ranges of parameter\nspace are incompatible with the observations. In particular we suggest that the\nbar must be fairly strong, must have an ILR, and cannot be too end-on, with the\nbar major axis at 35\\deg +/- 5\\deg to the line of sight. The H I data exhibit\nlarger forbidden velocities over a wider longitude range than are seen in\nmolecular gas; this important difference is the reason our favored model\ndiffers so significantly from other recently proposed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 1999 23:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
