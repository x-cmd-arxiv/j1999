We shall emphasize the importance of the timescale\nof the change in refractive index. This discussion will led us to propose a\nsomewhat different version of dynamical Casimir effect in which the change in\nvolume of the bubble is no longer the only source for the change in the\nrefractive index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 1999 02:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
