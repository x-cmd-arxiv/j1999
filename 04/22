Weak limits of oscillating sequences of\nsolutions are considered and along the same line the Wigner transform replaces\nthe Kolmogorov definition of the spectra of turbulence. One of the main issue\nis to show that, at least in some cases, this weak limit is the solution of an\nequation with an extra diffusion (the name turbulent diffusion appears\nnaturally). In particular for a weak limit of solutions of the incompressible\nEuler equation (which is time reversible) such process would lead to the\nappearance of irreversibility.
