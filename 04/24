Using a carefully selected subset of the recently published\nmultifrequency polarimetry observations of 300 radio pulsars (Gould & Lyne,\n1998), we attempt to model the shape of pulsar beams. Assuming that the beam\nshape is elliptical, in general, and that it may depend on the angle between\nthe rotation and the magnetic axes, we seek a consistent model where we also\nsolve for the dependence of the beam size on frequency. From the six-frequency\ndata on conal triple and multiple component profiles, we show that a) the\npulsar emission beams follow a nested cone structure with at least three\ndistinct cones, although only one or more of the cones may be active in a given\npulsar; b) each emission cone is illuminated in the form of an annular ring of\nwidth typically about 20% of the cone radius.\n  Although some slight preference is evident for a model where the beam is\ncircular for an aligned rotator & latitudinally compressed for an orthogonal\nrotator, the possibility that the beam shape is circular at all inclinations is\nfound to be equally consistent with the data.

The model describes the\nsuperexchange interactions that depend on the pattern of orbitals occupied. We\npresent the ground state properties of this model, depending on the splitting\nbetween the eg orbitals E_z, and the Hund's rule coupling in the excited d8\nstates, J_H. The classical phase diagram consists of six magnetic phases which\nall have different orbital ordering: two antiferromagnetic (AF) phases with\nG-AF order and either x2-y2 or 3z2-r2 orbitals occupied, two phases with mixed\norbital (MO) patterns and A-AF order, and two other MO phases with either C-AF\nor G-AF order. All of them become degenerate at the multicritical point\nM=(E_z,J_H)=(0,0). Using a generalization of linear spin-wave theory we study\nboth the transverse excitations which are spin-waves and\nspin-and-orbital-waves, as well as the longitudinal (orbital) excitations. The\ntransverse modes couple to each other, and the spin-and-orbital-wave turns into\na soft mode near the M point. Therefore, quantum corrections to the\nlong-range-order parameter are drastically increased near the orbital\ndegeneracy, and classical order is suppressed in a crossover regime between the\nG-AF and A-AF phases in the (E_z,J_H) plane. This behavior is reminiscent of\nthat found in frustrated spin models, and we conclude that orbital degeneracy\nprovides a new and physically realizable mechanism which stabilizes a spin\nliquid ground state due to inherent frustration of magnetic interactions. We\nalso point out that such a disordered magnetic phase is likely to be realized\nin LiNiO_2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 1999 08:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This\npaper describes a revised design and implementation of cdb that reduces the\nspace cost by nearly one-half and the time cost by 13% by storing symbol tables\nin external files.
