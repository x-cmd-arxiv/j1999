Thus, the symbol of any operator on the torus is\nderived as the projection of the symbol on the plane. The group properties\nallow us to derive the product law for an arbitrary number of operators in a\nsimple form. The analogy between the center and the chord representations on\nthe torus to those on the plane is then exploited to treat Hamiltonian systems\ndefined on the torus and to formulate a path integral representation of the\nevolution operator. We derive its semiclassical approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 1999 21:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
