It is a longstanding open problem to\ndetermine for which values of n this representation is faithful. It is known to\nbe faithful for n=3. Moody has shown that it is not faithful for n>8 and Long\nand Paton improved on Moody's techniques to bring this down to n>5. Their\nconstruction uses a simple closed curve on the 6-punctured disc with certain\nhomological properties. In this paper we give such a curve on the 5-punctured\ndisc, thus proving that the Burau representation is not faithful for n>4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 1999 15:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1999 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}
