Using the analytic model of McKee and Truelove (1995) for young\nsupernova remnants, and assuming the existence of overdense 56Fe-dominated\nclumps that contain also 44Ti, we show that a high degree of ionization may be\ncaused by the reverse shock so that the electron-capture rate of 44Ti could be\nsignificantly reduced from its laboratory value. When applied to Cas A, this\nincreases under certain conditions the current 44Ti-activity by a factor 1.5 -\n2.5, which yields a better compatibility between the COMPTEL observation of the\n1.16 MeV line activity associated with the 44Ti decay and the SN model\npredictions of the initial 44Ti abundance.

We found the surprising result that\nthe square lattice has a substantial larger melting temperature as compared to\nthe other lattice structures, which is a consequence of the specific topology\nof the temperature induced defects. A new melting criterion is formulated which\nwe show to be universal for bilayers as well as for single layer crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 1999 13:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This was\nbased on the fact that the evolution of a QFA is required to be reversible.\nWhen arbitrary intermediate measurements are allowed, this intuition breaks\ndown. Nonetheless, we show a 2^{Omega(n)} lower bound for such QFA for L_n,\nthus also improving the previous bound. The improved bound is obtained by\nsimple entropy arguments based on Holevo's theorem. This method also allows us\nto obtain an asymptotically optimal (1-H(p))n bound for the dense quantum codes\n(random access codes) introduced by Ambainis et al. We then turn to Holevo's\ntheorem, and show that in typical situations, it may be replaced by a tighter\nand more transparent in-probability bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1999 23:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 1999 00:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 1999 23:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On this basis, a symbolic calculus for quantum\nspins is developed, the `expectation-value representation.' It resembles the\nMoyal representation for SU(2) but two important differences exist.
