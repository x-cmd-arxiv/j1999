Recently Vaidman has extended\nthis idea to the ABL probabilities of the time-symmetrized version of quantum\nmechanics originated by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz. Several authors have\nobjected to Vaidman's time-symmetrized elements of reality without casting\ndoubt on the widely accepted sufficiency condition for `ordinary' elements of\nreality. In this paper I show that while the proper truth condition for a\nquantum counterfactual is an ABL probability of 1, neither a Born probability\nof 1 nor an ABL probability of 1 is sufficient for the existence of an element\nof reality. The reason this is so is that the contingent properties of\nquantum-mechanical systems are extrinsic. To obtain this result, I need to\ndiscuss objective probabilities, retroactive causality, and the objectivity or\notherwise of the psychological arrow of time. One consequence of the extrinsic\nnature of quantum-mechanical properties is that quantum mechanics presupposes\nproperty-defining actual events (or states of affairs) and therefore cannot be\ncalled upon to account for their occurrence (existence). Neither these events\nnor the correlations between them are capable of explanation, the former\nbecause they are causal primaries, the latter because they are fundamental:\nthere are no underlying causal processes. Causal connections are something we\nproject onto the statistical correlations, and this works only to the extent\nthat statistical variations can be ignored. There are nevertheless important\nconclusions to be drawn from the quantum-mechanical correlations, such as the\nspatial nonseparability of the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 1999 03:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
