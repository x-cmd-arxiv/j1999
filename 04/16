In the magnetohydrodynamic\ninduction equation, this current re-appears as source term for the poloidal\nmagnetic field, which can produce closed magnetic structures around an\naccreting black hole. In principle, even self-excited axisymmetric dynamo\naction is possible, which means that Cowling's anti-dynamo theorem does not\nhold in the Kerr metric.\n  Finally, simulations of the alpha-Omega dynamo in accretion flows into the\nhole are presented. I assume a simple expression of alpha in this relativistic\ncontext. The modes of the dynamo are oscillating for dynamo numbers which are\ntypical for accretion disks. In a zero angular momentum flow into a Kerr black\nhole there is still shear, i.e. the angular velocity, Omega, of the plasma\nequals the angular velocity of space, omega, and it has been speculated (Meier\n1998) that even then a dynamo could operate. This is shown to be unlikely due\nto the rapid accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 1999 13:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
