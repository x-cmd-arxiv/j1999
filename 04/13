For the case of a\nstep, the magnitude and velocity dependence of the friction force are strongly\ndependent on the direction of sliding respect to the step and the corrugation\nstrength. When the applied force F is perpendicular to the step, the film is\npinned forF less than a critical force Fc. Motion of the film along the step,\nhowever, is not pinned. Fluctuations in the sliding velocity in time provide\nevidence of both stick-slip motion and thermally activated creep. Simulations\ndone with a substrate containing a 5 percent concentration of random point\ndefects for various directions of the applied force show that the film is\npinned for the force below a critical value. The critical force, however, is\nstill much lower than the effective inertial force exerted on the film by the\noscillations of the substrate in experiments done with a quartz crystal\nmicrobalance (QCM). Lowest order perturbation theory in the substrate potential\nis shown to give results consistent with the simulations, and it is used to\ngive a physical picture of what could be expected for real surfaces which\ncontain many defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 1999 19:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 1999 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This means that\ngravitational forces can be reduced, inverted and intensified by means of\nelectromagnetic fields. Such control of the gravitational interaction can have\na lot of practical applications. For example, a new concept of spacecraft and\naerospace flight arises from the possibility of the electromagnetic control of\nthe gravitational mass. The novel spacecraft called Gravitational Spacecraft\npossibly will change the paradigm of space flight and transportation in\ngeneral. Here, its operation principles and flight possibilities, it will be\ndescribed. Also it will be shown that other devices based on gravity control,\nsuch as the Gravitational Motor and the Quantum Transceivers, can be used in\nthe spacecraft, respectively, for Energy Generation and Telecommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 1999 22:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 17:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 13 May 2010 19:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2010 19:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2010 17:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2010 12:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 19:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2010 13:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2013 17:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1999 18:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2009 15:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 18:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2009 18:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2009 21:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2009 14:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2009 13:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2010 18:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-04"}
