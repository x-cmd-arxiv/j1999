As in conservative mechanics, one can\nconsider the Poisson bracket of constraints, separate them in first and second\nclass constraints, construct the Koszul-Tate resolution and a BRST complex.\nHowever, the Poisson bracket of constraints and a Hamiltonian makes no sense.\nHamiltonian vector fields for first class constraints are not generators of\ngauge transformations. In the case of Lagrangian constraints, we state the\ncomprehensive relations between solutions of the Lagrange equations for an\nalmost regular Lagrangian and solutions of the Hamilton equations for\nassociated Hamiltonian forms, which live in the Lagrangian constraint space.\nDegenerate quadratic Lagrangian systems are studied in details. We construct\nthe Koszul-Tate resolution for Lagrangian constraints of these systems in an\nexplicit form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1999 08:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A related triumph a deep understanding of the\nforces of interaction. In particular, it has been possible to understand the\nfour fundamental forces of nature in an elegant and unified mathematical\nframework. The paradigm for this unification has been the principle of gauge\nsymmetry.\n  A new approach to achieving further unification relies on Supersymmetry. This\nis a symmetry which relates particles of integer spin with those of\nhalf-integral spin and also dictates the allowed interactions among these\nparticles. However, no data exist pointing to the presence of this symmetry; it\nmay indeed be of no relevance to nature.\n  In this paper the gauge principle and unification attempts are briefly\nreviewed, and then Supersymmetry is introduced. The notion of \"broken\" symmetry\nis discussed, which may explain why the symmetry is difficult to observe at\npresently accessible energies. But a badly broken manifestation seems to remove\nmuch of the original appeal and elegance of the theory. We here propose two\nalternative views of the status of Supersymmetry from fundamental standpoint.\nThere is a good reason why it is indeed a fundamental symmetry, despite badly\nbroken.
