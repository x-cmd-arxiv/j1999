The planetary nebulae (PN) cover a range of galactocentric radius from\n7.9 to 17.7 arcmin (8 to 18Kpc). The spectra display typical emission lines of\nH I, He I, He II, [O III], [N II] and [S II] and appear very similar to high\nexcitation planetary nebulae in the Galaxy. This implies that, from a stellar\nevolution viewpoint, there should be no peculiar effects introduced by\nconsidering the bright cut-off of the PN luminosity function for distance\nestimation. In particular the brightest PN detected in NGC 5128 is not\nspectroscopically unusual. One of the PN shows relatively strong He II and [N\nII] lines and the derived N/O ratio indicates that it may be a Type I nebula,\nconsidered to arise from a high mass progenitor star. Determinations of the\noxygen abundance of the five PN shows a mean value 0.5 dex below solar. Given\nthat NGC 5128 is an elliptical galaxy with a presumably metal rich stellar\ncontent, the low metallicities of the PN are unexpected, although a similar\nsituation has been observed in the bulge of M 31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 1999 12:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We compare our analytical predictions with numerical simulations.\nThe good agreement allows us to conclude that, up to temperatures where\nkink-antikink nucleation processes cannot be neglected, a diffusion constant\nlinear and quadratic in temperature gives a very accurate description of the\ndiffusive motion of the kink. The quadratic temperature dependence is shown to\nstem from the interaction with the phonons. In addition, we calculate and\ncompute the average value $<\\phi(x,t)>$ of the wave function as a function of\ntime and show that its width grows with $\\sqrt{t}$. We discuss the\ninterpretation of this finding and show that it arises from the dispersion of\nthe kink center positions of individual realizations which all keep their\nwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 1999 08:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We analyze the dependence\nof the lifetime of the initial state on the intensity of the laser field. The\nphenomenon we discuss is related to both electromagnetic induced transparency\nand quantum Zeno effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 1999 08:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
