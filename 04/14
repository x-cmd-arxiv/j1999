We study the\nproblem of when such a polygon $K$ tiles the plane multiply when translated at\nthe locations $\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is a multiset in the plane. The\npairing property of $K$ makes this question particularly amenable to Fourier\nAnalysis. After establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for $K$ to\ntile with a given lattice $\\Lambda$ (which was first found by Bolle for the\ncase of convex polygons-notice that all convex polygons that tile, necessarily\nhave the pairing property and, therefore, our theorems apply to them) we move\non to prove that a large class of such polygons tiles only quasi-periodically,\nwhich for us means that $\\Lambda$ must be a finite union of translated\n2-dimensional lattices in the plane. For the particular case of convex polygons\nwe show that all convex polygons which are not parallelograms tile necessarily\nquasi-periodically, if at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 1999 15:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmain mechanical feature of chiral interaction is its mode of selecting one\ndirection of rotation out of two possible and opposite ones. For example, a\ngiven chiral device such as a rotating water sprinkler, rotates in one\ndirection. What does rotate in the opposite direction is the mirror of this\ngiven sprinkler. This mode of operation indicates space-time (PT) invariance\nwhich causes it to be also time-irreversible. This also causes a chiral device\nto become non-ergodic on microscopic level.
