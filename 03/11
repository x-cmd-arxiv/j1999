We\nfocus mainly on the problem of regularisation of the field theory. Our analysis\nbegins with an investigation of the spectral properties of the purely classical\nevolution operator. We show that, although the kinetic equation is formally\ntime-reversible, density relaxation is controlled by {\\em irreversible}\nclassical dynamics. In the case of a weak magnetic field, the effective kinetic\noperator corresponds to diffusion in the angle space, the diffusion constant\nbeing determined by the spectral resolution of the inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield. Applying these results to the quantum problem, we demonstrate that the\nlow-lying modes of the field theory are related to the eigenmodes of the\nirreversible classical dynamics, and the higher modes are separated from the\nzero mode by a gap associated with the lowest density relaxation rate. As a\nconsequence, we find that the long-time properties of the system are\ncharacterised by universal Wigner-Dyson statistics. For a weak magnetic field,\nwe obtain a description in terms of the quasi one-dimensional non-linear\n$\\sigma$-model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 19:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The properties of these pairs and their role is similar to those of the\nprincipal nilpotents. To any principal nilpotent pair we associate a\ntwo-parameter analogue of the Kostant partition function, and propose the\ncorresponding two-parameter analogue of the weight multiplicity formula.\n  In a different direction, each principal nilpotent pair gives rise to a\nharmonic polynomial on the Cartesian square of the Cartan subalgebra, that\ntransforms under an irreducible representation of the Weyl group. In the\nspecial case of sl_n, the conjugacy classes of principal nilpotent pairs and\nthe irreducible representations of the Symmetric group, S_n, are both\nparametrised (in a compatible way) by Young diagrams. In general, our theory\nprovides a natural generalization to arbitrary Weyl groups of the classical\nconstruction of simple S_n-modules in terms of Young's symmetrisers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 20:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 1999 19:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 May 1999 20:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
