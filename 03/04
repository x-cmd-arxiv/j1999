We\nuse those families as building blocks to model real galaxies and calculate the\nPVDs obtained for various realistic combinations of periodic orbit families and\nfor a number of viewing angles with respect to the bar. We show that the global\nstructure of the PVD is a reliable bar diagnostic in edge-on disks.\nSpecifically, the presence of a gap between the signatures of the families of\nperiodic orbits in the PVD follows directly from the non-homogeneous\ndistribution of the orbits in a barred galaxy. Similarly, material in the two\nso-called forbidden quadrants of the PVD results from the elongated shape of\nthe orbits. We show how the shape of the signatures of the dominant x1 and x2\nfamilies of periodic orbits in the PVD can be used efficiently to determine the\nviewing angle with respect to the bar and, to a lesser extent, to constrain the\nmass distribution of an observed galaxy.

A similar conservation theorem can be\nproven for linearized gravitational fields off of a stationary, asymptotically\nflat background, with the second order Einstein tensor playing the role of an\neffective stress-energy tensor of the linearized field. In this paper, we prove\nthe above theorems for smooth sources and then investigate the extent to which\nthey continue to hold for point particle sources. The ``self-energy'' of point\nparticles is ill defined, but in the electromagnetic case, we can consider\nsituations where, initially and finally, the point charges are stationary and\nin the same spatial position, so that the self-energy terms should cancel.\nUnder certain assumptions concerning the decay behavior of source-free\nsolutions to Maxwell's equations, we prove the vanishing of the sum of the net\nenergy radiated to infinity and the net work done on the particle by the\nDeWitt-Brehme radiation reaction force.

This leads directly to a novel method for the numerical evaluation of\nthese integrals, which avoids the use of Monte Carlo techniques. Our approach\nis based on based on the theory of generalized sinc ($\\sin(x)/x$) functions,\nfrom which we derive an approximation to the propagator that is expressed as an\ninfinite sum. When the propagators in the Feynman integrals are replaced with\nthe approximate form all integrals over internal momenta and vertices are\nconverted into Gaussians, which can be evaluated analytically. Performing the\nGaussians yields a multi-dimensional infinite sum which approximates the\ncorresponding Feynman integral. The difference between the exact result and\nthis approximation is set by an adjustable parameter, and can be made\narbitrarily small. We discuss the extraction of regularization independent\nquantities and demonstrate, both in theory and practice, that these sums can be\nevaluated quickly, even for third or fourth order diagrams. Lastly, we survey\nstrategies for numerically evaluating the multi-dimensional sums. We illustrate\nthe method with specific examples, including the the second order sunset\ndiagram from quartic scalar field theory, and several higher-order diagrams. In\nthis initial paper we focus upon scalar field theories in Euclidean spacetime,\nbut expect that this approach can be generalized to fields with spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 1999 01:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 1999 18:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

If we\nrestrict the head of the automaton to moving classically and to moving only in\none direction, the acceptance power of this 1-way quantum finite automaton is\nreduced to a proper subset of the regular languages.\n  In this paper we study two different models of 1-way quantum finite automata.\nThe first model, termed measure-once quantum finite automata, was introduced by\nMoore and Crutchfield, and the second model, termed measure-many quantum finite\nautomata, was introduced by Kondacs and Watrous.\n  We characterize the measure-once model when it is restricted to accepting\nwith bounded error and show that, without that restriction, it can solve the\nword problem over the free group. We also show that it can be simulated by a\nprobabilistic finite automaton and describe an algorithm that determines if two\nmeasure-once automata are equivalent.\n  We prove several closure properties of the classes of languages accepted by\nmeasure-many automata, including inverse homomorphisms, and provide a new\nnecessary condition for a language to be accepted by the measure-many model\nwith bounded error. Finally, we show that piecewise testable languages can be\naccepted with bounded error by a measure-many quantum finite automaton, in the\nprocess introducing new construction techniques for quantum automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 1999 22:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2000 21:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2000 20:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
