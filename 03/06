One peaks in the IR - to soft X-ray band, radiating via\nthe synchrotron process; the other, peaking in the high-energy gamma-rays, is\nproduced by the Compton process. These spectra -- and, in particular, the \\asca\ndata -- suggest that the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization is\ndiverse. In the High-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs), the dominant seed\nphotons for Comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to the\njet (SSC process). In the quasar-hosted blazars (QHBs), on the other hand, the\nX-ray band emission is still dominated by the SSC process, while the MeV to GeV\nrange is produced by Comptonization of external photons such as the emission\nline light. In the context of this three-component model, we derive the\nmagnetic field of 0.1 - 1 Gauss for all classes of blazars. Lorentz factors\ngamma_{peak} of electrons radiating at each peak of the nuFnu spectra are\nestimated to be ~10^{5}$ for HBLs; this is much higher than ~10^{3}$ for QHBs.\nThis difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that are\nknown to emit TeV gamma-rays (TeV blazars) are all classified as HBLs.

Then we move in\nSection 2 to a presentation of cancellation diagrams and show how they can be\nused computationally. In Section 3 we give a formal algebraic presentation of\nthe concept of group computation structure, which is based on the standard\nnotions of free group and conjugacy.

The presence of non-perturbative\nstates accounts for the discrepancy between Monte Carlo and perturbative\nresults for the universal ratio xi/xi_2nd. We introduce and study some\nuniversal amplitude ratios related to the overlap of the spin operator with the\nstates of the spectrum. The analysis is performed for the phi^4 theory\nregularized on a lattice and for the Ising model. This is a nice verification\nof the fact that universality reaches far beyond critical exponents. Finally,\nwe show that the spectrum of the model, including non-perturbative states,\naccurately matches the glueball spectrum in the Z(2) gauge model, which is\nrelated to the Ising model through a duality transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 1999 17:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
