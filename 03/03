A simple fit to this relation\nallows the UV flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-free\nUV luminosity to be determined. IUE spectra and IRAS fluxes of local starbursts\nare used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 Angstrom absorption A_{1600},\nand the transformation from broad band color to \\beta. We show that the recent\nmarginal and non-detections of HDF U-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm are\nconsistent with our calculated A_{1600}.
