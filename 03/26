UGC2855 is shown to belong to the\nrare class of galaxies with a long (~ 8kpc) continuous molecular bar. The\nvelocity field along the bar is dominated by solid-body rotation and shows few\nperturbations. This, together with an almost constant and low ^12CO/^13CO line\nintensity ratio along the bar and in the center as well as only weak H alpha\nemission, indicate that the gas in the bar is not subjected to strong shocks,\nbut surprisingly quiescent. In the central 3'', a high velocity feature\nconsisting of a number of Giant Molecular Associations, is identified. We\ndiscuss possible scenarios of the nature of this structure in connection with\nthe question of the presence of an Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) in the bar.\nWe suggest that the bar of UGC2855 is a young object, possibly has no ILR, and\nthat the mass concentration toward the center of the galaxy is just beginning.\nIn contrast, the companion UGC2866 experiences a strong starburst. We compare\nthe properties of the gas in the bar of UGC2855 to those we find in NGC7479.\nDespite superficial parallels, the two bars are very dissimilar objects in\nterms of ^12CO/^13CO line ratio, velocity field and H alpha activity. NGC7479\nexhibits starburst characteristics, while we argue that UGC2855 is in a\npre-burst stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 1999 12:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

EMQG is a quantum gravity theory (ref. 1) in which the\nvirtual particles of the quantum vacuum play a very important role in all\ngravitational interactions, and also in accelerated motion. According to EMQG\ntheory (and quantum field theory in general), empty space is populated by vast\nnumbers of virtual particles, consisting of virtual fermion and virtual\nanti-fermion particles, which posses mass, and also virtual boson particles of\nall the various force particle species. Therefore the problem of the\ncosmological constant is essentially equivalent to a determination of the mass\ncontributed by all the virtual particles of the vacuum to the overall curvature\nand dynamics of the entire universe. Our original analysis was based on the\nassumption of perfect symmetry in the creation and destruction of virtual\nfermion and virtual anti-fermion particle pairs in the quantum vacuum, which is\nin accordance with the existing laws of conservation of both electric charge,\nand also of the new law of conservation of gravitational 'mass charge'.

Contrary to some suggestions, no spectacular\neffects may be expected. When the dielectric constant of the spheres\n$\\epsilon_s$ is greater than the dielectric constant $\\epsilon_b$ of the\nbackground medium, then for any filling fraction $f$ there exists a critical\n$\\epsilon_c$ above which the lowest lying Mie resonance frequency falls inside\nthe lowest stop gap in the (111) crystal direction, close to its midgap\nfrequency. If $\\epsilon_s <\\epsilon_b$, the correspondence between Mie\nresonances and both the (111) stop gap and a full gap does not follow such a\nregular pattern. If the Mie resonance frequency is close to a gap edge, one can\nobserve a resonance-induced widening of a relative gap width by $\\approx 5%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 1999 11:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
