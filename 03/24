A qualitative global fit to all the observed CMD\nfeatures is attempted, and a general scheme for the Star Formation History of\nthe Sgr is derived. According to this scheme, star formation began at very\nearly time from a low metal content Inter Stellar Medium and lasted for several\nGyr, coupled with progressive chemical enrichment. The Star Formation Rate\n(SFR) had a peak from 8 to 10 gyr ago when the mean metallicity was in the\nrange -1.3<= [Fe/H] <= -0.7. After that maximum, the SFR rapidly decreased and\nvery low rate star formation took place until ~1-0.5 Gyr ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 1999 15:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For given input parameters, the prediction of ${\\cal B}(B\\to\\eta' K)$\nis largely improved by setting Nc(LL)~2 and Nc(LR)>Nc(LL); in particular, the\ncharm content of the eta' contributes in the right direction. The decay rate of\n$B\\to\\phi K^*$ is very sensitive to the form-factor ratio A_2/A_1; the absence\nof $B\\to\\phi K$ events does not necessarily invalidate the factorization\napproach. If the branching ratio of $B^-\\to\\omega K^-$ is experimentally found\nto be significantly larger than that of $B^-\\to\\rho^0 K^-$, we argue that\ninelastic final-state rescattering may account for the disparity between\n$\\omega K^-$ and $\\rho^0 K^-$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1999 23:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 1999 05:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

The most suitable way to\nconsistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of\nkaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean\nHamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing\nstates are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are\neigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly\nmanifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely\ndetermine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude:\nCPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final\nstates can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related\nto the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct\nmeasurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on\nCPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+\npi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together\nwith estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to\ndetermine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal\nviolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1999 16:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Well defined states are obtained for infinite\ntime, which are related to a ''weak form'' of intrinsic irreversibility. Real\nand complex generalized spectral decompositions of the Liouville-Von Neumann\nsuperoperator are computed. The physical meaning of ''Gamov states'' is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 1999 12:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
