We argue that the persistence of neutron star\nmagnetic fields on timescales of $10^9$ y suggests a superconducting gap curve\nwith local maximum at intermediate density. We discuss the implications for\nexotic core phenomena such as pion/kaon condensation or a transition to quark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 1999 21:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
