The\nmean optical SED is found to evolve passively towards a mid F-star dominated\nspectrum by z ~ 2. We demonstrate with realistic simulations that hotter\nellipticals would be readily visible if evolution progressed blueward and\nbrightward at z > 2, following a standard IMF. The colour distributions are\nbest fitted by a `red' IMF, deficient above ~2 M_solar and with a spread of\nformation in the range 1.5 < z_f < 2.5. Traditional age dating is spurious in\nthis context, a distant elliptical can be young but appear red, with an\napparent age >3 Gyrs independent of its formation redshift. Regarding density\nevolution, we demonstrate that the sharp decline in numbers claimed at z > 1\nresults from a selection bias against distant red galaxies in the optical,\nwhere the flux is too weak for morphological classification, but is remedied\nwith relatively modest IR exposures revealing a roughly constant space density\nto z ~ 2. We point out that the lack of high mass star-formation inferred here\nand the requirement of metals implicates cooling-flows of pre-enriched gas in\nthe creation of the stellar content of spheroidal galaxies.

Interesting is that in these models the gaugino condensation\nnecessarily occurs and hence these models may play a role of so-called hidden\nsector for supersymmetry breaking in supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 1999 02:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 1999 06:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
