The opacity\nof this cooled gas can reduce the overall X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow,\nand values of Mdot based on these luminosities can underestimate the true value\nby factors of ~2. We find that accumulated cooled material can produce emergent\nsurface brightness profiles much like those observed even for nearly\nhomogeneous gas distributions. Consequently, much more of the gas may be\ncooling below X-ray emitting temperatures in the central regions of cooling\nflows (r < 10 kpc) than one would infer from observed X-ray surface brightness\nprofiles assuming the gas was optically thin. Similarly, the central densities\nand pressures in cooling flows may have been underestimated. We show that\ndistributed absorption in cooling flows produces a number of observable effects\nin the spectrum which may allow it to be differentiated from absorption due to\ngas in our Galaxy. These include a characteristic suppression of the continuum\nbelow ~2 keV, absorption features such as a redshifted O K-edge, and diminished\nintensity of resonance emission lines. Spectra including the effects of\nintrinsic absorption are not well fit by foreground absorbing models.\nAttempting to fit such models to the spatially resolved spectra can lead to\nunderestimates of the true absorbing column by factors of 3-20.

This has previously been shown in\nthe ``doubled'' formalism for maximal supergravities, where a generalised\nduality relation between original and dual field strengths replaces the\nequations of motion. In the doubled formalism, the gauge transformations\ngenerate a superalgebra, and the corresponding symmetries have accordingly been\ncalled ``superdualities.'' The corresponding Noether charges form a\nrepresentation of the cohomology ring on the spacetime manifold. In this paper,\nwe show that the gauge symmetry superalgebra implies certain non-trivial\nrelations among the various p-brane tensions, which can straightforwardly be\nread off from the superalgebra commutation relations. This provides an elegant\nderivation of the brane-tension relations purely within a given theory, without\nthe need to make use of duality relations between different theories, such as\nthe type IIA/IIB T-duality, although the results are consistent with such\ndualities.
