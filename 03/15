Instead of\nsearching for the negative-energy solution of the nucleon's Dirac equation, we\nsolve the Dirac equations for the nucleon and the anti-nucleon simultaneously.\nThe single-particle energies of negative-energy nucleons are obtained through\nchanging the sign of the single-particle energies of positive-energy\nanti-nucleons. The contributions of the Dirac sea to the source terms of the\nmeson fields are evaluated by means of the derivative expansion up to the\nleading derivative order for the one-meson loop and one-nucleon loop. After\nrefitting the parameters of the model to the properties of spherical nuclei,\nthe results of positive-energy sector are similar to that calculated within the\ncommonly used relativistic mean field theory under the no-sea approximation.\nHowever, the bound levels of negative-energy nucleons vary drastically when the\nvacuum contributions are taken into account. It implies that the\nnegative-energy spectra deserve a sensitive probe to the effective interactions\nin addition to the positive-energy spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 1999 14:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 1999 07:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

It extends\nthe meaning of ``measurement'' to include all property-indicating facts.\nIntrinsically space is undifferentiated: there are no points on which a world\nof locally instantiated physical properties could be built. Instead, reality is\nbuilt on facts, in the sense that the properties of things are extrinsic, or\nsupervenient on property-indicating facts. The actual extent to which the world\nis spatially and temporally differentiated (that is, the extent to which\nspatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by the facts) is\nnecessarily limited. Notwithstanding that the state vector does nothing but\nassign probabilities, quantum mechanics affords a complete understanding of the\nactual world. If there is anything that is incomplete, it is the actual world,\nbut its incompleteness exists only in relation to a conceptual framework that\nis more detailed than the actual world. Two deep-seated misconceptions are\nresponsible for the interpretational difficulties associated with quantum\nmechanics: the notion that the spatial and temporal aspects of the world are\nadequately represented by sets with the cardinality of the real numbers, and\nthe notion of an instantaneous state that evolves in time. The latter is an\nunwarranted (in fact, incoherent) projection of our apparent ``motion in time''\ninto the world of physics. Equally unwarranted, at bottom, is the use of causal\nconcepts. There nevertheless exists a ``classical'' domain in which language\nsuggestive of nomological necessity may be used. Quantum mechanics not only is\nstrictly consistent with the existence of this domain but also presupposes it\nin several ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 1999 03:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 1999 08:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2000 05:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
