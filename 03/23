Section\n2 introduces the Fourier decomposition, a tool to describe quantitatively the\nlight curves of pulsating stars. Sect. 3 shows how an observational result was\nprogressively built on the basis of old and new data; the latter were collected\non selected targets just to clarify some controversial points. Since different\npulsation modes were suspected among Cepheids, an independent confirmation was\nsearched for. To do that we applied the least-squares technique to Double Mode\nCepheids. By obtaining a very satisfactory description of their pulsational\ncontent (Sect.4), we could confirm that between Cepheids with P<8d they are\nboth fundamental and first overtone pulsators (Sect.5). The detection of small\namplitude cross-coupling terms and higher harmonics in the light curves of\nDouble Mode Cepheids allowed us to quantify the properties of the high-order\nterms and hence to discover other peculiarities (Sect.6), very useful to\ncomplete the scenario of the resonance effects and to test some theoretical\nmodels (Sect.7). Therefore, we can study the Cepheids from the point of view of\nasteroseismology since to find resonance effects is as to sound their\ninteriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 1999 16:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with\nwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. In small mass halos, galaxy\nformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,\nwhereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the\ngas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at the\nhalo mass associated with L* galaxies. This leads to a scale dependent bias in\nthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large\nscales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the\nbias in the distribution of massive halos. On small scales, the correlation\nfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including the\nspatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the number\nof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,\ndynamical friction.

But just what gravitational mass is, how gravitational behavior\ncomes about, what in material reality produces the effects of gravitational\nmass, has been little understood. The only extant hypotheses involve the\nunsuccessful efforts to develop \"quantum gravitation\" and to tie it into the\nrest of quantum mechanics, and the equally failed attempts to detect\n\"gravitons\" and \"gravitational waves\" in spite of very substantial efforts.\n  From a starting point of only the limitation on the speed of light, the\nnecessity of conservation, and the impossibility of an infinity in material\nreality, the present paper presents a new and comprehensive analysis of the\nphenomenon gravitational mass:\n  - how it appears in particles,\n  - how the Newtonian gravitational behavior arises from that, and\n  - how the values of inertial mass and gravitational mass are identical, or,\nin other words, the mechanics of gravitational mass and gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1999 00:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2003 19:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2005 18:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 19:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nreformulation of the quantum searching algorithm also enables a detailed\nanalysis of the decoherence effects caused by its coupling with an environment.\nIt turns out that the environment will not only make the quantum search invalid\nin case of complete decoherence, where the probability of finding the marked\nstate is unchanged, but also it may make the quantum search algorithm worse\nthan expected: It will decrease this probability when the environment shows its\nquantum feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1999 07:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The propagation of\nsuch initial wave functions is not well described by the Schr\\\"odinger current\nwhich vanishes on the boundary of the support of the wave function. This\npropagation gives rise to a uni-directional current at the boundary of the\nsupport. We use path integrals to define current and uni-directional current\nand give a direct derivation of the expression for current from the path\nintegral formulation for both diffusion and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we\ngive an explicit asymptotic expression for the short time propagation of\ninitial wave function with compact support for both the cases of discontinuous\nderivative and discontinuous wave function. We show that in the former case the\nprobability propagated across the boundary of the support in time $\\Delta t$ is\n$O(\\Delta t^{3/2})$ and the initial uni-directional current is $O(\\Delta\nt^{1/2})$. This recovers the Zeno effect for continuous detection of a particle\nin a given domain. For the latter case the probability propagated across the\nboundary of the support in time $\\Delta t$ is $O(\\Delta t^{1/2})$ and the\ninitial uni-directional current is $O(\\Delta t^{-1/2})$. This is an anti-Zeno\neffect. However, the probability propagated across a point located at a finite\ndistance from the boundary of the support is $O(\\Delta t)$. This gives a decay\nlaw.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1999 11:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
