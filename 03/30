The underlying infrared spectrum of the source, as observed during\nradio and X-ray quiescence and small flaring states, is one of broad, weak HeII\nand NV emission. Spectral variability in this state is dominated by modulation\nat the 4.8 hr orbital period of the system. H-band spectra confirm the\nsignificant hydrogen depletion of the mass donor. The closest spectral match to\nthe quiescent infrared spectrum of Cyg X-3 is an early-type WN Wolf-Rayet star.\n  In outburst, the infrared spectrum is dramatically different, with the\nappearance of very strong twin-peaked HeI emission displaying both day-to-day\nvariability and V(iolet)/R(ed) variations with orbital phase.

In contrast to\nprevious well-studied radio afterglows which rise to peak flux on a timescale\nof a week and then decay over several weeks to months, the radio emission from\nthis GRB was clearly detected one day after the burst, after which it rapidly\nfaded away. The simplest interpretation of this ``radio flare'' is that it\narises from the reverse shock. In the framework of the afterglow models\ndiscussed to date, a forward shock origin for the flare is ruled out by our\ndata. However, at late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate with\nthe observed late-time optical emission, the optical afterglow) is expected\nfrom the forward shock. The relative faintness of the observed late-time radio\nemission provides an independent indication for a jet-like geometry in this\nGRB. We use the same radio observations to constrain two key parameters of the\nforward shock, peak flux and peak frequency, to within a factor of two. These\nvalues are inconsistent with the notion advocated by several authors that the\nprompt optical emission detected by ROTSE smoothly joins the optical afterglow\nemission. Finally, with hindsight we now recognize another such radio flare and\nthis suggests that one out of eight GRBs has a detectable radio flare.

The angular resolutions are ~50 and ~130\narcsec, therefore much higher than for the previously available radio images of\nthis region. The most interesting feature detected is a large-scale jet that\nconnects the inner radio lobe and the NML and that is imaged for the first\ntime. The NML itself appears as diffuse emission with a relatively bright ridge\non the eastern side. The radio morphology of Centaurus A and, in particular,\nits NML could be the result of a precessing jet that has undergone a strong\ninteraction with the environment at least in the northern side. The very big\ndrop in intensity between the inner jet and the large-scale jet can be\nexplained with a sequence of bursts of activity at different epochs in the life\nof the source. Alternatively (or additionally) a ``bursting bubble'' model is\nproposed which could also explain the good collimation of the large-scale jet.\nIn this model, the plasma accumulated in the inner lobe would be able to\n``burst'' out only through one nozzle that would be the region where the\nlarge-scale jet forms. From the comparison between the radio emission and the\nregions of ionized gas we find that the inner optical filament falls about 2\narcmin (~2 kpc) away from the large-scale radio jet. Thus, this filament does\nnot seem to have experienced a direct interaction with the radio plasma. The\nouter filaments appear to be, in projection, closer to the radio emission,\narguing for a direct interaction with the radio jet. However, also in this case\na more complicated interaction than assumed so far has to be occuring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 1999 09:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The power spectrum is very similar to that of other\nlow-luminosity neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and to black-hole\ncandidates when these types of source accrete at their lowest observed mass\naccretion rates.

The production of s-process elements in thermally pulsing\nasymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operation\nof two neutron sources: the dominant reaction 13C(alpha,n)16O, which releases\nneutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase, and the reaction\n22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg, marginally activated during thermal instabilities.

Starting from the\nKadanoff-Baym equations we derive in first order gradient expansion equations\nof motion for testparticles with respect to their time evolution in \\vec{X},\n\\vec{P} and M^2. The off-shell propagation is demonstrated for a couple of\nmodel cases that simulate hadron-nucleus collisions. In case of nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions the imaginary part of the hadron self-energy \\Gamma_X is determined\nby the local space-time dependent collision rate dynamically. A first\napplication is presented for A + A reactions up to 95 A MeV, where the effects\nfrom the off-shell propagation of nucleons are discussed with respect to high\nenergy proton spectra, high energy photon production as well as kaon yields in\ncomparison to the available data from GANIL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 1999 13:35:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 1999 01:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
