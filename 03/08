We find that the variation of the HBO frequency with accretion rate\npredicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolar\nstellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion disk\nagrees well with the observed variation. This model implies that the neutron\nstars in the Z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magnetic\nfield strengths are ~10^9-10^10 G, and that the critical fastness parameter for\nthese sources is >0.8. If the frequency of the upper kilohertz QPO is an\norbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequency\nmodel requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couple\nstrongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead drifts\nslowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers of\nthe neutron star surface. The Lense-Thirring precession model is consistent\nwith the observed magnitudes of the HBO frequencies only if the moments of\ninertia of the neutron stars in the Z sources are 4-5 times larger than the\nlargest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. The\ntrend of the correlation between the HBO and upper kHz QPO frequencies is not\nconsistent with this model. We argue that the change in the slope of the\ncorrelation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and the\nfrequency of the upper kilohertz QPO, when the latter is greater than 850 Hz,\nis directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz QPOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 1999 20:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
