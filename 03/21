The resulting lower limit to the\ncentral magnetic field is ~1 - 3 uG While a magnetic field of ~0.1 - 0.2 uG can\nbe created by galaxy wakes, a magnetic field of several uG is usually\nassociated with a cooling flow or, as in the case of the Coma cluster, a\nsubcluster merger. However, for A2256, the evidence for a merger is weak and\nthe main cluster shows no evidence of a cooling flow.
