It is morphologically best characterized as a discontinuity in u,\nu-y, with stars in the range 11,500<Teff(K)<20,000 deviating systematically\nfrom (in the sense of appearing brighter and/or hotter than) canonical ZAHBs.\nWe present u, y photometry of 14 GCs obtained with 3 different telescopes\n(Danish, NOT, HST) and demonstrate that the u-jump is present in every GC whose\nHB extends beyond 11,500K, irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB,\nand other GC parameters. We suggest that the u-jump is a ubiquitous feature,\nintrinsic to all HB stars hotter than 11,500K. We draw a parallel between the\nubiquitous nature of the u-jump and the problem of low measured gravities among\nBHB stars. We note that the \"logg-jump\" occurs over the same temperature range\nas the u-jump, and that it occurs in every metal-poor GC for which gravities\nhave been determined--irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB, or any\nother GC parameters. Furthermore, the u-jump and the logg-jump are connected on\na star-by-star basis. The two are likely different manifestations of the same\nphysical phenomenon. We present a framework which may simultaneously account\nfor the u-jump and the logg-jump. Reviewing spectroscopic data for several\nfield BHB stars, as well as two BHB stars in the GC NGC 6752, we find evidence\nthat radiative levitation of heavy elements takes place at Teff>11,500 K,\ndramatically enhancing their abundances in the atmospheres of BHB stars in the\n\"critical\" temperature region. Model atmospheres taking diffusion effects into\naccount are badly needed, and will likely lead to better overall agreement\nbetween canonical evolutionary theory and observations for BHB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 1999 20:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 1999 22:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-05"}

Using this analogy, we investigate the applicability of a real\nspace renormalisation group approach, originally developped for quantum spin\nsystems, to interacting particle systems. We apply the technique to an exactly\nsolvable reaction-diffusion system and to the contact process (both in $d=1$).\nIn the former case, several exact results are recovered. For the contact\nprocess, surprisingly good estimates of critical parameters are obtained from a\nsmall-cell renormalisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 09:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nobtain two more functional relations for the eigenvalues of the transfer\nmatrices for the $sl(3)$ chiral Potts model at $q^2=-1$. This model, up to a\nmodification of boundary conditions, is equivalent to the three-layer\nthree-dimensional Zamolodchikov model. From these relations we derive the Bethe\nansatz equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 05:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
