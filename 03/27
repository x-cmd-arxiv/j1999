In combination with a previous study of galaxies\nand Lyman-$\\alpha$ clouds, we are able to provide a unified description of\nstructure formation, verified against a large variety of observations. We also\ntake into account the clumping of the baryonic gas in addition to the presence\nof collapsed objects. We consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with a\nCDM power-spectrum and an open universe with $\\Omega_0=0.3$, $\\Lambda=0$. The\nderived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at\n$z<4.5$ and with constraints over larger redshifts from the HDF. The radiation\nproduced by these objects at $z \\sim 16$ slowly reheats the universe which gets\nsuddenly reionized at $z_{ri}=6.8$ for the open universe ($z_{ri}=5.6$ for the\ncritical density universe). The UV background radiation simultaneously\nincreases sharply to reach a maximum of $J_{21} = 0.18$ at $z=2.6$, but shows\nstrong ionization edges until $z \\leq 1$. The metallicity of the gas increases\nquickly at high $z$ and is already larger than $0.01 Z_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$. The\nQSO number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift to\nbe $z_{ri} \\sim 6$. We confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed in\norder to satisfy the observations. Due to the low reionization redshift, the\ndamping of CMB fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. with\nthe NGST) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the HI and\nHeII opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is due\nto QSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 1999 18:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main idea of Lunn and\nSenior is that if the type of isomerism is fixed, a molecule with a fixed\nskeleton and d univalent substituents has a symmetry group $W\\leq S_d$ which is\ngenerally not the molecule's 3-dimensional symmetry group. The unit character\nof W induces a representation of the symmetric group $S_d$ which governs the\ncombinatorics of the isomers of the given molecule. Lunn-Senior's thesis is\nthat certain non-negative integers established by this representation are upper\nboundaries of the corresponding numbers, yielded by the experiment (and often\ncoincide with them). Moreover, the authors define (in a particular case) a\npartial order among the objects of the model, such that some simple\nsubstitution reactions correspond to inequalities. These two groups of data\ndetermine the group W, and produce so called \"type properties\" of the molecule\n(properties which do not depend on the nature of the univalent substituents).\nOur hypothesis is that if we replace the unit character of $W$ by any\none-dimensional character of $W$ (thus we count only a part of the isomers -\nthose having a maximum property), we also get a type property of the molecule.\nAn instance of that is the inventory of the stereoisomers called chiral pairs.\nThe formalism can be generalized naturally and produces some preliminary\nchemical results. Especially the partial order is defined and studied in the\ngeneral case and indicates the possible genetic relations among the\ncorresponding molecules. An important result of E.

The n+t elastic cross section has been calculated\nusing several realistic interactions and a phenomenological three-nucleon\nforce. Special attention is devoted to the description of the observed resonant\nstructure at $T_{lab}\\approx 4$ MeV. In the present state of the calculations,\nthe realistic NN interactions are unable to describe the energy region\nconsidered, i.e. n+t S- and P- waves. Whereas the inclusion of a three-nucleon\nforce improves the zero energy region, the disagreement in the resonant peak\nremains. This failure contrasts with the results of a pure phenomenological\nmodel. The origin of this disagreement as well as the possible issues are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 1999 16:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
