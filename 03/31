The light distribution of the cluster is\nmodeled using an isophotal analysis of an HST V-band image from the HST Data\nArchive, combined with new ground-based K-band imaging.

We infer an average proper coherence time of 0.4 +/- 0.1\nfm/c, corresponding to a coherence path length of 8 +/- 2 fm in the rest frame\nof the nucleus. Finally, we apply the linear extrapolation to measured J/Psi\nproduction cross sections for 200 and 450 GeV/c protons incident on a variety\nof nuclear targets. Our analysis takes into account energy loss of the beam\nproton, the time delay of particle production due to quantum coherence, and\nabsorption of the J/Psi on nucleons. The best representation is obtained for a\ncoherence time of 0.5 fm/c, which is consistent with Drell-Yan production, and\nan absorption cross section of 3.6 mb, which is consistent with the value\ndeduced from photoproduction of the J/Psi on nuclear targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 1999 22:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
