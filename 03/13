By correcting for the\nenergy-dependent point-spread function of the ASCA instruments, we have\nexamined the temperature structure of the cluster. The cluster's core within 3'\nis found to have a temperature of 6.46+-0.87 keV, significantly higher than\n3.10+-1.19 keV in the surrounding region of r = 3 - 6'. This radially\ndecreasing temperature structure can be parameterized by a polytropic index of\n$\\gamma$ $\\simeq$ 1.45. The X-ray morphology of the cluster appears elongated\nand clumpy on scales $\\le$1'. These results, together with earlier {\\it ROSAT}\nand optical studies which revealed that the X-ray centroid and ellipticity of\nA2111 shift with spatial scale, are consistent with the hypothesis that the\ncluster is a dynamically young system. Most likely, the cluster has recently\nundergone a merger, which may also be responsible for the high fraction of blue\ngalaxies observed in the cluster. Alternatively, the temperature structure may\nalso be due to the gravitational potential of the cluster. We have further\nmeasured the emission weighted abundance of the X-ray-emitting intracluster\nmedium as 0.25$\\pm$0.14 solar. This value is similar to those of nearby\nclusters which do not show a large blue galaxy fraction, indicating that star\nformation in disk galaxies and subsequent loss to the medium do not drastically\nalter the average abundance of a cluster. This is consistent with recent\nresults which indicate that cluster abundances have remained constant since at\nleast z ~ 0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 1999 16:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
