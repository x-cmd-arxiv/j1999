We make the case, using all the available evidence, that we\nare observing a region at the nearer end of the Galactic bar, where the Scutum\nspiral arm breaks away, and that this is powerful evidence for the presence of\nthe bar. Alternative explanations do not give nearly such a satisfactory\naccount of the observations.\n  The space localization of one and, a fortiori, of both ends of the bar allows\nus to infer a position angle for the bar of around 75 deg. with respect to the\nSun-Galactic centre line. The angle is different from that given by other\nauthors for the bar and this, we think, is because they refer to the triaxial\nbulge and not to the bar as detected here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 1999 13:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Our first system involves\nthe heat equation on the lattice Z^d, with a nonlinear noise term u(t,x)^gamma\ndB_x(t), with 1/2 <= gamma < 1. The B_x are independent Brownian motions. When\ngamma = 1/2, the measure which puts mass u(t,x) at x is a super-random walk and\nit is well-known that the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s.\nFinite-time extinction is known to be a.s. false if gamma = 1.

Roughly speaking, this\nprocess consists of 2 superprocesses with the continuous time simple random\nwalk as the underlying spatial motion.

Equations with and without cosmological terms, are derived for\nthe closed and open uniform isotropic models of the Universe for the\ngravitational field in vacuum and arbitrary material field. The respective\nsolutions without singularities were obtained for all these cases. It is shown\nthat there is no necessity to quantize the obtained general equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 1999 00:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 15:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 16:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 16:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 14:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 17:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 16:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}
