When damping for the\nAFM fluctuation strongly depends on the dSC correlation length through the\nformation of precursor singlets around (\\pi,0) and (0,\\pi) points in the\nmomentum space, the pseudogap appears in a region of the normal state\ncharacterized by decreasing 1/T_1T and increasing AFM correlation length with\ndecrease in temperature. This reproduces a characteristic feature of the\npseudogap phenomena in many underdoped cuprates. When the damping becomes\ninsensitive to the dSC correlation length, the pseudogap region shrinks as in\nthe overdoped cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 1999 05:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 10:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the\nabsence of ab initio theory, the surprises embodied in the experimental data\nwere imputed to effects of dynamical correlations. We summarize results of ab\ninitio investigations of linear response, performed within time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT), in which the unexpected features of the\nobserved spectra are shown to be due to band-structure effects. Contrary to\nconventional wisdom, the response cannot be understood \"universally,\" in terms\nof a simple scaling with the density, on going from metal to metal (e.g.,\nthrough the alkali series) --even the shape of the dispersion curve for the\nplasmon energy is system-specific. The second part of this article starts out\nwith the observation that a similar ab initio study of systems with more\ncomplex electronic structures would require the availability of a realistic\napproximation for the dynamical many-body kernel entering the density-response\nfunction in TDDFT. Thus, we outline a diagrammatic alternative, framed within\nthe conserving-approximation method of Baym and Kadanoff. Using as a benchmark\nthe band gap of Si obtained in the GW approximation, together with a\ndiagrammatic (and conserving) solution of the ensuing Bethe-Salpeter equation,\nwe discuss issues involving conservation laws, self-consistency, and sum rules.\nThese conceptual issues are particularly important for the development of ab\ninitio methods for the study of dynamical response and quasiparticle band\nstructure of strongly-correlated materials.
