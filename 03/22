The\nordered moment grows from 0.018(2) mB/U-atom for pure UPt3 to 0.048(8)\nmB/U-atom for x= 0.005. The Neel temperature, TN, is approximately 6 K and does\nnot vary with Pd contents. The order parameter for the SMAF has an unusual\nquasi-linear temperature variation. For x>= 0.01 a large moment\nantiferromagnetic phase (LMAF) is found. For this phase at optimum doping (x=\n0.05) TN attains a maximum value of 5.8 K and the ordered moment equals 0.63(5)\nmB/U-atom. TN(x) for the LMAF follows a Doniach-type phase diagram.
