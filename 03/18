An\nasymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this\nweakly excitable large core regime starting from the free-boundary limit of the\nreaction-diffusion models, valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin\ninterface. The wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip\nregion and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale.\nThis separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the\nwave tip, with the large scale motion of the spiral wavefront slaved to the\ntip.

The result is that for $n \\leq 8$ there are no unexpected ones (one\ntype of six lines, four types of eight lines). And for n=10 a partial\nclassification is given in the following sense: Each even set of ten lines on a\nsmooth quartic surface is of one of eleven different types. At the moment I do\nnot know which of these types do actually occur. The proof for these facts is\nmessy, essentially checking cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 1999 09:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The motion equations of probability amplitude functions of\nclassical statistical system are obtained, which are similar to that in quantum\nmechanics. It is also proved in the meantime that microsystems that obey\nquantum mechanics can also be described in the forms of classical statistical\nmechanics and deterministic classical mechanics. The quantum revised formula of\nclassical interaction force and the revised Liouville's equations are also\nobtained. In this way, the transformation of two descriptive forms between\nclassical mechanics and quantum mechanics is achieved. A new and rational\ninterpretation about quantum mechanics, including the meaning of wave function,\nthe potential barrier penetration of microparticles, the Uncertainty relation,\nthe wave-particle duality, the essence of spin and the Bell's inequality and so\non, is provided in the paper. Based on the transformation, two fundamental\nhypotheses are put forward as the basic postulates of classical statistical\nphysics.
