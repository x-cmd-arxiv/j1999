The power law continuum flux has changed by\na factor of 2 over a time-scale of ~ 2 years for both objects, declining in the\ncase of NGC 4388 and rising in ESO 103-G35. No variation was observed in the\nequivalent width of the Fe K alpha line in the spectra of NGC 4388, implying\nthat the line flux declined with the continuum.

The equivalent width of the Fe K alpha\nemission line is seen to decrease between the observations of ESO 103-G35 while\nthe continuum flux increased. The 1996 observation of ESO 103-G35 can also be\nfitted with an absorption edge at 7.4 $\\pm$ 0.2 keV due to partially ionized\niron, and when an ionized absorber model is fitted to the data it is found that\nthe equivalent column of neutral hydrogen rises to 3.5 x 10^23 cm^-2.
