However, we were able to follow the changes in the\npositions of the components along the first 2 mas of the jet with respect to\nthe core. The resolution achieved by these observations allows the\ndecomposition of the apparent velocity vector of each component into two\northogonal directions. We find evidence of reverse motion for a component along\nthe jet.

The\nspontaneous curvature is in turn strongly influenced by the composition of\nfilm.

This situation is contrasted with that of\nquantum dots where electron-electron interaction severely limits the number of\nresolved excitations. Unlike the case of quantum dots, the scattering rate in\natoms is found to decrease with increasing excitation energy. The different\neffect of electron-electron interaction on the spectrum of quantum dots and\natoms is traced to the different confining potentials in the two systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 1999 15:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Note by\n$Met(E_{n})$ the space of hermitian metrics $h$ on $E_{n}$. Also, consider\n$Met(W_{n})$, the space of metrics on $H^{0}(X,E_{n})$. Although $Met(W_{n})$\nis finite dimensional, it's dimension grows with $n$. So we can ask how to\nobtain a way to describe particular metrics of $Met(E_{n})$ using $Met(W_{n})$.\nFirst, we link these two spaces by two morphisms $L_{n}$ and $I_{n}$. Donaldson\ngave a criterion for detecting Einstein Hermitian metrics on $Met(E_{n})$,\nusing a functional $\\mathcal M$. We construct another functional on\n$Met(W_{n})$, $\\mathcal KN_{n}$, using an algebraic idea of Kempf and Ness. In\nour investigations we prove that the variation of the analytic torsion, when\n$h$ varies, becomes small when $n$ grows . However our main result is that\n$\\mathcal M-\\mathcal KN\\circ L_{n}$ becomes small when $n$ grows.\n  Moreover, with some hypotheses, we show that Yang-Mills minimum can be\ncharacterized(appromimately) by $\\mathcal KN_{n}$. The proof of our main\ntheorem is based on constructing \"concentrated\" sections of $E_{n}$, in a way\nsimilar to Donaldson's recent work on symplectic varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 1999 09:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1999 07:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
