The images, taken in open filter (50CCD) mode, clearly reveal\nthe presence of a galaxy which was obscured in earlier (June 1997) HST images\nby emission from the optical transient (OT). The galaxy is regular in shape:\nafter correcting for the HST/STIS PSF, it is well-fitted by an exponential disk\nwith a scale length of 0.\"046 +/- 0.\"006 and an ellipticity of 0.70 +/- 0.07.\nAll observations are marginally consistent with a continuous decline in OT\nemission as t^{-1.3} beginning two days after outburst; however, we find no\ndirect evidence in the image for emission from the OT, and the surface\nbrightness profile of the galaxy is most regular if we assume that the OT\nemission is negligible, suggesting that the OT may have faded more rapidly at\nlate times than is predicted by the power-law decay. Due to the wide bandwidth\nof the STIS clear mode, the estimated magnitude of the galaxy is dependent on\nthe galaxy spectrum that is assumed. Using colors obtained from late-time\nground-based observations to constrain the spectrum, we find V = 25.4 +/- 0.15,\na few tenths of a magnitude brighter than earlier ground-based estimates that\nwere obtained by observing the total light of the galaxy and the OT and then\nsubtracting the estimated OT brightness assuming it fades as a single\npower-law.

This remarkable agreement raises the\npossibility that the GRB may have been associated with either an active\ngalactic nucleus or a nuclear starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 1999 01:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Thirring in\n1918 using general relativity. The Lense-Thirring effect can also be thought of\nas the 'dragging of inertial frames', as first named by Einstein himself.

However,\nrecent work using the LAGEOS series, earth orbiting satellites has rendered an\nunconfirmed experimental value that agrees with theory to an accuracy of about\n20 %. Our physical model is based on the disturbance of the electrically\ncharged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum in a state of free-fall near a\nmassive spinning object.
