After reviewing tests of statistics for various particles, and\ntypes of statistics that are neither Bose nor Fermi, I discuss quons, particles\ncharacterized by the parameter $q$, which permit a smooth interpolation between\nBose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$ gives fermions. The new\nresult of this talk is work by Robert C. Hilborn and myself that gives a\nheuristic argument for an extension of conservation of statistics to quons with\ntrilinear couplings of the form $\\bar{f}fb$, where $f$ is fermion-like and $b$\nis boson-like. We showed that $q_f^2=q_b$. In particular, we related the bound\non $q_{\\gamma}$ for photons to the bound on $q_e$ for electrons, allowing the\nvery precise bound for electrons to be carried over to photons. An extension of\nour argument suggests that all particles are fermions or bosons to high\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 1999 22:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
