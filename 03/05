Our theory starts\nout from similar but more general chemical assumptions to those of Eigen,\nnamely that catalytic replication can lead to a large population of long\nchains. In particular, our models incorporate the possibility of (i) direct\nchain growth, (ii) template-assisted synthesis and (iii) catalysis by RNA\nreplicase ribozymes, all with varying degrees of efficiency. However, in our\nmodels the reaction mechanisms are kept `open'; we do not assume the existence\nof closed hypercycles which sustain a population of long chains. Rather it is\nthe feasibility of the initial emergence of a self-sustaining set of RNA chains\nfrom monomeric nucleotides which is our prime concern. We confront directly the\ncentral nonlinear features of the problem, which have often been overlooked in\nprevious studies. Our detailed microscopic kinetic models lead to kinetic\nequations which are generalisations of the Becker-Doring system (BD) for the\nstep-wise growth of clusters or polymer chains; they lie within a general\ntheoretical framework which has recently been successfully applied to a wide\nrange of complex chemical problems. In fact, the most accurate model we\nconsider has BD aggregation terms, together with a general Smoluchowski\nfragmentation term to model the competing hydrolysis of RNA polymer chains. We\nconclude that, starting from reasonable initial conditions of monomeric\nnucleotide concentrations within a prebiotic soup and in an acceptable\ntimescale, it is possible for a self-replicating subset of polyribonucleotide\nchains to be selected, while less efficient replicators become extinct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 1999 17:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We note, however, that the origin of this\nunderlying resistivity anisotropy remains unknown, and is not addressed here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 1999 01:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 1999 01:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 1999 18:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A major\ntheoretical challenge posed by their existence is to understand why they are so\nlight. A scenario is presented where one assumes a parity doubling of the\nstandard model with identical matter and gauge content. The neutrinos of the\nparity doubled (mirror) sector are light for the same reason that the known\nneutrinos are light and since they do not couple to the known W and Z bosons,\nthey can be identified with the sterile neutrinos. Some of the implications and\npossible tests of this hypothesis are mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 1999 18:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There are two solutions in type IIB string theory: an AdS$_3$\nbubble corresponds to the dilatonic solution, while an exact AdS$_3$ is the\nnon-dilatonic solution. In order to obtain the cross section for an AdS$_3$\nbubble, we introduce the \\{out\\}-state scattering picture with the AdS$_3$-AFS\nmatching procedure. For an exact AdS$_3$, one considers the \\{in\\}-state\nscattering picture with the AdS$_3$-AdS$_3$ matching. Here the non-normalizable\nmodes are crucially taken into account for the matching procedure. It turns out\nthat the cross sections for the test fields in an AdS$_3$ bubble take the same\nforms as those in an exact AdS$_3$. This suggests that in the dilute gas and\nthe low energy limits, the S-matrix for an AdS$_3$ bubble can be derived from\nan exact AdS$_3$ space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 1999 05:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 1999 03:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The scattering\ntheory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations,\nhas been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant\nstates in the framework of quantum theory. The resulting evolution law of the\nunstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a\nwell-defined function in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space.
