The fast variation of\norder milliseconds in the time profile is then a natural expectation, given the\nother observed GRB parameters. Analytic calculations are presented to show that\nthe escape of non-thermal, energetic gamma rays can emerge within a second of\nthe thermal photons from a gammasphere of below $10^{12}$ cm. The minimum\nasymptotic bulk Lorentz factor in this model is found to be of order several\nhundred if the photosphere is of order $3 \\times 10^{11}$ cm and greater for\nlarger or smaller photospheric radii. It is suggested that prompt UHE gamma\nrays might provide a new constraint on the asymptotic Lorentz factor of the\noutflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 1999 08:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 1999 13:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that the effect of the boundary is quite different in\nboth cases: diffusion-reaction leads to a density excess, whereas ballistic\nannihilation exhibits a density deficit, and in both cases the effect is not\nlocalized at the boundary but penetrates into the system. The field-theoretic\nrenormalization group is used to obtain the universal properties of the density\nexcess in two dimensions and below for the reaction-diffusion system.
