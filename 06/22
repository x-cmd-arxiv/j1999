We find that, independent of numerical resolution\nand dissipation, the only models that produce scale-free, power-law\nDelta-variance spectra are those with hypersonic Mach numbers above M ~ 4,\nwhile slower supersonic turbulence tends to show characteristic scales and\nproduce non-power-law spectra. Magnetic fields have only a minor influence on\nthis tendency, though they tend to reduce the scale-free nature of the\nturbulence, and increase the transfer of energy from large to small scales. The\nevolution of the characteristic length scale seen in supersonic turbulence\nfollows exactly the t^{1/2} power-law predicted from recent studies of the\nkinetic energy decay rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 16:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The centroid density is related to\nthe quasi-static response of the equilibrium system to an external force. The\npath centroid dispersion is the canonical correlation of the position operator,\nthat measures the linear change in the mean position of a quantum particle upon\nthe application of a constant external force. At low temperatures, this\nquantity provides an approximation to the excitation energy of the quantum\nsystem. In the zero temperature limit, the particle's probability density\nobtained by fixed centroid path integrals corresponds to the probability\ndensity of minimum energy wave packets, whose average energy define the Feynman\neffective classical potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 16:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The present paper studies first a more\ngeneral form of such a scheme for bosonic gauge theories, by adding to the\nboundary operator for mixed boundary conditions of local nature a two-by-two\nmatrix of pseudo-differential operators with pseudo-homogeneous kernels. The\nrequest of invariance of such boundary conditions under infinitesimal gauge\ntransformations leads to non-local boundary conditions on ghost fields. In\nEuclidean quantum gravity, an alternative scheme is proposed, where non-local\nboundary conditions and the request of their complete gauge invariance are\nsufficient to lead to gauge-field and ghost operators of pseudo-differential\nnature. The resulting boundary conditions have a Dirichlet and a\npseudo-differential sector, and are pure Dirichlet for the ghost. This approach\nis eventually extended to Euclidean Maxwell theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 1999 09:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 1999 16:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The wave\nfunction in the presence of such detector vanishes on the detector. The trace\nthe absorbed particles leave on the detector is identifies as the absorption\ncurrent density on the detector. This density is calculated from the solution\nof Schr\\\"odinger's equation with a reflecting boundary at the detector. This\ncurrent density is not the usual Schr\\\"odinger current density. We define the\nprobability distribution of the time of arrival to a detector in terms of the\nabsorption current density. We define coordinate measurement by an absorbing\nwall in terms of 4 postulates. We postulate, among others, that a quantum\nparticle has a trajectory. In the resulting theory the quantum mechanical\ncollapse of the wave function is replaced with the usual collapse of the\nprobability distribution after observation. Two examples are presented, that of\nthe slit experiment and the slit experiment with absorbing boundaries to\nmeasure time of arrival. A calculation is given of the two dimensional\nprobability density function of a free particle from the measurement of the\nabsorption current on two planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

In particular, we rely on quantum data compression and teleportation\nto create the desired state. This protocol can be used to obtain upper bounds\nfor the bipartite entanglement of formation of an arbitrary N-partite pure\nstate, in the asymptotic limit of many copies. We apply it to a few\nmultipartite states of interest, showing that in some cases it is not optimal.\nGeneralizations of the protocol are developed which are optimal for some of the\nexamples we consider, but which may still be inefficient for arbitrary states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 21:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 1999 14:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 1999 11:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
