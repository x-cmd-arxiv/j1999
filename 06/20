We use VLA and ROSAT images of the\nradio-bright supernova remnant 3C 397 (G41.1--0.3) to examine the shock\nstructure in both thermal X-ray emission and nonthermal radio emission. The\nunusual rectangular morphology can be seen in VLA maps at 20 and 6 cm\nwavelength at a resolution of 6\", and in ROSAT HRI images. The X-ray images\nresemble the radio strongly, except for a small, possibly un resolved X-ray hot\nspot near the center. There is no variation in the X-ray hardness ratio from\nROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data across the remnant,\nsuggesting that at least between 0.4 and 2 keV, the interior emission is not\ndifferent in character from that in the bright shell regions. Thus 3C 397 is\nnot a member of the ``thermal composite'' or ``mixed-morphology'' class (Rho\n1998). The remnant is unpolarized at 20 cm, and has a mean fractional\npolarization of 1.5% +/- 0.1% at 6 cm. The polarized flux, and polarized\nfraction, peak inside the remnant at a location not coincident with either an\ninternal maximum in total-intensity radio emission, or with the X-ray hot spot.\nSpectral-index maps between 6 and 20 cm do not show any systematic differences\nassociated with interior emission; there appears to be no ``plerionic'' or\npulsar-driven component in 3C 397 at least as normally characterized by high\npolarization and a flat radio spectrum. Spectral-index values spread about the\nmean by about 0.2, a result consistent with previous work. We make calculations\nof the upstream electron diffusion coefficient and the mean density. Finally,\nwe speculate on possible mechanisms producing the X-ray hot spot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 1999 16:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
