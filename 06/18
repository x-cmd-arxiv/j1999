A similar feature has been observed in TON\nS180 (another NLSy1) but has not been observed in broad-line Seyfert galaxies.\nThe feature energy suggests a large contribution from Fe L-shell lines but its\nintensity is difficult to explain in terms of emission and/or absorption from\nphotoionized gas. Models based on gas in thermal equilibrium with kT ~1 keV\nprovide an alternative parameterization of the soft spectrum. The latter may be\ninterpreted as the hot intercloud medium, undergoing rapid cooling and\nproducing strong Fe L-shell recombination lines. In all cases the physical\nconditions are rather different from those observed in broad-line Seyferts. The\nhard X-ray spectrum shows a broad and asymmetric Fe Kalpha line of large\nequivalent width (~550 eV) which can be explained by a neutral disk viewed at ~\n60 degrees to the line-of-sight, contrary to the hypothesis that NLSy1s are\nviewed pole-on. The large EW of this line, the strong 1 keV emission and the\nstrong optical Fe emission lines all suggest an extreme Fe abundance in this\nand perhaps other NLSy1s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 1999 16:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that if about ten percent of the SN\nenergy can power the acceleration of particles from the material inside the SB,\nthe observed abundances of LiBeB in halo stars, as a function of O, can be\nexplained in a fully consistent way over several decades of metallicity. In\nthis model, the energetic particles (EPs) reflect the SB material, which is a\nmixing of the ejecta of previous SNe and of the swept-up ISM gas evaporated off\nthe shell. We investigated two different energy spectra for the EPs: the\nstandard cosmic ray source spectrum, or `SNR spectrum', and a specific `SB\nspectrum', as results from the SB acceleration mechanism of Bykov & Fleishman\n(1992). While the latter spectrum is more efficient in producing LiBeB, the SNR\nspectrum can be reconciled with the observational data if an imperfect mixing\nof the SN ejecta with the rest of the SB material and/or a selective\nacceleration is invoked (enhancing the C and O abundance amongst the EPs by a\nfactor of ~ 6).

We\npropose an observational test of this feature. We also show that the recent 6Li\nobservations in halo stars fit equally well in the framework of the SB model.\nFinally, we conjecture the existence of two sets of low-metallicity stars,\ndiffering in their Be/Fe or B/O abundance ratios, resulting from a `bimodal'\nLiBeB production in the Galaxy, namely from correlated (in SBs) or isolated SN\nexplosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 1999 18:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We investigate these systems using a simple hierarchical\nclustering model of galaxy evolution, in which the large luminosity of the\nSCUBA galaxies is assumed to be generated at the epoch of galaxy mergers in a\nburst of either star formation activity or the fuelling of an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). The models are well constrained by the observed spectrum of the\nFIR/submm background radiation and the 60-micron counts of low-z IRAS galaxies.\nThe ratio between the total amount of energy released during mergers and the\nmass of dark matter involved must increase sharply with z at z<1, and then\ndecrease at higher z, independent of the fraction of the luminosity of mergers\nthat is produced by starbursts and AGN. One additional parameter - the\nreciprocal of the product of the duration of the enhanced luminosity produced\nby the merger and the fraction of mergers that induce an enhanced luminosity,\nwhich we call the activity parameter - is introduced, to allow the relationship\nbetween merging dark matter haloes and the observed counts of distant dusty\ngalaxies to be investigated. The observed counts can only be reproduced if the\nactivity parameter is greater by a factor of about 5 and 100 at redshifts of 1\nand 3 respectively, compared with the present epoch. Hence, if mergers account\nfor the SCUBA galaxies, then the merger process must have been much more\nviolent at high redshifts. We discuss the counts of galaxies and the intensity\nof background radiation in the optical/near-IR wavebands in the context of\nthese hierarchical models, and thus investigate the relationship between the\npopulations of SCUBA and Lyman-break galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 1999 14:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 1999 10:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The reasons of\nthe instabilities can be geometric (shadowing effect), but they are mostly\nkinetic or thermodynamic. The kinetic instabilities which will be studied in\ndetail in chapters IV and V result from the fact that adatoms diffusing on a\nsurface do not easily cross steps (Ehrlich-Schwoebel or ES effect).

When the growth front is a\nstepped surface, the ES effect initially produces a meandering of the steps,\nwhich eventually may also give rise to mounds. Kinetic instabilities can\nusually be avoided by raising the temperature, but this favours thermodynamic\ninstabilities. Concerning these ones, the attention will be focussed on the\ninstabilities resulting from slightly different lattice constants of the\nsubstrate and the adsorbate. They can take the following forms. i) Formation of\nmisfit dislocations (chapter VIII). ii) Formation of isolated epitaxial\nclusters which, at least in their earliest form, are `coherent' with the\nsubstrate, i.e. dislocation-free (chapter X). iii) Wavy deformation of the\nsurface, which is presumably the incipient stage of (ii) (chapter IX).

The Dirac procedure is used to eliminate the\nconstraints in the gauge-fixed front form theory quantum action and to\nconstruct the LF Hamiltonian formulation. The physical degrees of freedom\nemerge naturally. The propagator of the dynamical $\\psi_+$ part of the free\nfermionic propagator in the LF quantized field theory is shown to be causal and\nnot to contain instantaneous terms. Since the relevant propagators in the\ncovariant gauge formulation are causal, rotational invariance---including the\nCoulomb potential in the static limit---can be recovered, avoiding the\ndifficulties encountered in light-cone gauge. The Wick rotation may also be\nperformed allowing the conversion of momentum space integrals into Euclidean\nspace forms. Some explicit computations are done in quantum electrodynamics to\nillustrate the equivalence of front form theory with the conventional covariant\nformulation. LF quantization thus provides a consistent formulation of gauge\ntheory, despite the fact that the hyperplanes $x^{\\pm}=0$ used to impose\nboundary conditions constitute characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 1999 22:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

As a limit of the Meixner ensemble or the\nCharlier ensemble we obtain the Plancherel measure on partitions, and using\nthis we prove a conjecture of Baik, Deift and Johansson that under the\nPlancherel measure, the distribution of the lengths of the first k rows in the\npartition, appropriately scaled, converges to the asymptotic joint distribution\nfor the k largest eigenvalues of a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary\nEnsemble. In this problem a certain discrete kernel, which we call the discrete\nBessel kernel, plays an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 1999 09:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 1999 07:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2004 18:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Particular attention is devoted to forecast\nthe amplitude and phase of one of the most common solar indicator activity, the\ninternational monthly smoothed sunspot number. It is well known that the solar\ncycle is very difficult to predict due to the intrinsic complexity of the\nrelated time behaviour and to the lack of a succesful quantitative theoretical\nmodel of the Sun magnetic cycle. Starting from a previous recent work, we\nchecked the reliability and accuracy of a forecasting model based on concepts\nof nonlinear dynamical systems applied to experimental time series, such as\nembedding phase space, Lyapunov spectrum, chaotic behaviour. The model is based\non a local hypothesis of the behaviour on the embedding space, utilizing an\noptimal number k of neighbour vectors to predict the future evolution of the\ncurrent point with the set of characteristic parameters determined by several\nprevious parametric computations. The performances of this method suggest its\nvaluable insertion in the set of the so-called statistical-numerical prediction\ntechniques, like Fourier analyses, curve fitting, neural networks,\nclimatological, etc. The main task is to set up and to compare a promising\nnumerical nonlinear prediction technique, essentially based on an inverse\nproblem, with the most accurate predictive methods like the so-called\n\"precursor methods\" which appear now reasonably accurate in predicting \"long\nterm\" Sun activity, with particular reference to the \"solar\" precursor methods\nbased on a solar dynamo theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 1999 14:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 07:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
