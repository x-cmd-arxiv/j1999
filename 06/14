In its simplest realization\n(probably the only one) these are scalar fields as envisaged by Higgs but in\nthe present formulation without the ``symmetry-breaking Higgs condensate''. The\nfinal result agrees precisely with the usual quantization of a classical gauge\ntheory by means of the Higgs mechanism. Our method proves an old conjecture of\nCornwall, Levin and Tiktopoulos stating that the renormalization and\nconsistency requirements of spin=1 particles lead to the gauge theory structure\n(i.e. a kind of inverse of 't Hooft's famous renormalizability proof in\nquantized gauge theories) which was based on the on-shell unitarity of the\n$S$-matrix. We also speculate on a possible future ghostfree formulation which\navoids ''field coordinates'' altogether and is expected to reconcile the\non-shell S-matrix point of view with the off-shell field theory structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 1999 21:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 1999 16:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 16:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
