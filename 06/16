For the chosen accretion rates, hydrogen burns\nin a series of recurrent mild flashes and the ashes of hydrogen burning build\nup a helium layer at the base of which a He flash eventually occurs. In\nprevious studies involving accretion at higher rates and including initially\nmore massive WDs, the diffusion of energy inward from the H shell-flashing\nregion contributes to the increase in the temperature at the base of the helium\nlayer, and the mass of the helium layer when the He flash begins is\nsignificantly smaller than in a comparison model accreting pure helium; the He\nshell flash is not strong enough to develop into a supernova explosion. In\ncontrast, for the conditions adopted here, the temperature at the base of the\nHe layer becomes gradually independent of the deposition of energy by H shell\nflashes, and the mass of the He layer when the He flash occurs is a function\nonly of the accretion rate, independent of the hydrogen content of the accreted\nmatter. When the He flash takes place, due to the high degeneracy at the base\nof the He layer, temperatures in the flashing zone will rise without a\ncorresponding increase in pressure, nuclear burning will continue until nuclear\nstatistical equilibrium is achieved; the model will become a supernova, but not\nof the classical type Ia variety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 1999 12:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The method consists in a\ndecomposition of these light curves into a series of twelve self-similar\nflares. With a model-independent parameterization, we find that the obtained\noutburst's evolution is in good qualitative agreement with the expectations of\nshock models in relativistic jets. We then derive, by a second approach, the\nrelevant parameters of three-stage shock models.\n  We observe for the first time that the optically thin spectral index is\nsteeper during the initial rising phase of the evolution than during the final\ndeclining phase as expected by the shock model of Marscher & Gear (1985).
