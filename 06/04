The interface\nbetween the outflow and ambient IGM is demarcated by a dense expanding shell\nformed by the gas swept-up by the outflow. A sufficiently high IGM pressure can\nbring the shell to a halt well before it escapes the galaxy.

Hence, they will also be subject to ram pressure,\nwhich acts to strip the gas from the galaxy.

For the\nanalyses of the spin-spin correlations in top quark production, we introduce a\ngeneric spin basis and show which spin basis is the most optimal. We discuss\nthe spin-angular correlations for the top quark decay, and demonstrate that the\ndirections of electro-weak decay products of polarized top quarks are strongly\ncorrelated to the top quark spin. We also explain how to measure the top quark\nspin using decay products. The spin correlations using the generic spin basis\nare extensively studied at the next to leading order of QCD for top quark\nproductions at e^+e^- colliders. The radiative corrections induce an anomalous\n\\gamma/Z magnetic moment for the top quarks and allow for real gluon emissions.\nTherefore they might change the leading order analyses.

Because of the relatively large expansion\nparameter, it is only at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) where one can\nexpect to see agreement with experiment at the few percent level. The first\npart of this talk will focus on radiation pion effects, which first appear at\nNNLO. The power counting for radiation pions is simple for center of mass\nmomentum p~\\sqrt{M m_pi}=Q_r, the threshold for pion production. We explain how\ngraphs calculated with the Q_r power counting scale for p~m_\\pi. The Q_r^3\nradiation pion contributions to nucleon-nucleon scattering are suppressed by\ninverse powers of the S-wave scattering lengths. However, we point out that\norder Q_r^4 radiation contributions might give a NNLO contribution for p~m_pi.\nIn the second part of the talk, results for the potential pion and contact\ninteraction part of the NNLO 1S0 phase shift are presented. We emphasize the\nimportance of eliminating spurious poles in the expression for the amplitude at\neach order in the perturbative expansion. Doing this leaves a total of three\nfree parameters at NNLO. We obtain a good fit to the 1S0 phase shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 1999 20:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
