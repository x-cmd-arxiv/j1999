It is found that the radiative force by an intensive\nstarburst can support a stable gaseous wall with a scale-height of several\nhundred parsecs. Moreover, by taking the simple stellar evolution in the\nstarburst into account, we find that the covering factor of the wall decreases\non a time-scale of several $10^7$ yr. The large-scale wall, if formed, works to\nobscure the nucleus due to the dust opacity. Hence, it is anticipated that the\nindex of AGN type tends to shift from higher to lower in several $10^7$ yr\naccording as the circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer. On the other hand, if\nthe AGN itself is brighter than the circumnuclear starburst (e.g. quasar case),\nno stable large-scale wall forms. In that case, the AGN is highly probably\nidentified as type 1.
