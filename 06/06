We\ndiscuss the numerical time-evolution of a given black-hole-containing initial\ndata slice in spherical symmetry. We avoid singularities via the \"black-hole\nexclusion\" or \"horizon boundary condition\" technique, where the slices meet the\nblack hole's singularity, but on each slice a spatial neighbourhood of the\nsingularity is excluded from the domain of the numerical computations.\n  After first discussing some of the key design choices which arise with the\nblack hole exclusion technique, we then give a detailed description of our\nnumerical evolution scheme for spherically symmetric scalar field evolution,\nassuming that a black hole is already present on the initial slice. We use a\nfree evolution, with Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates and the inner\nboundary placed at a fixed coordinate radius well inside the horizon.\n  Our numerical scheme is based on the method of lines (MOL), where spacetime\nPDEs are first finite differenced in space only, yielding a system of coupled\nODEs for the time evolution of the field variables along the spatial-grid-point\nworld lines. These ODEs are then time-integrated by standard methods. We use\n4th order finite differencing in both space and time, with 5 and/or 6 point\nspatial molecules (off-centered near the grid boundaries), and a Runge-Kutta\ntime integrator.
