The approach is based on\nfactorization of a non-homogeneous first order differential operator to\nproducts consisting of a scalar function, a homogeneous first order\ndifferential operator and the reciprocal of the scalar function. The\nfactorization procedure is utilized to show that all totally linear\ndifferential equations of first order can be transformed to each other, and in\nparticular to a homogeneous one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 1999 21:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
