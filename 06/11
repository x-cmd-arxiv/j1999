The influence of these environmental properties on the\nresulting SNe Ia is studied in this paper. First it is shown that the carbon\nmass fraction X(C) in the C+O white dwarf SN Ia progenitors tends to be smaller\nfor lower metallicity and older the binary system age. It is then suggested\nthat the variation of X(C) causes the diversity in the brightness of SNe Ia: a\nsmaller X(C) leads to a dimmer SN Ia. Further studies of the propagation of the\nturbulent flame are necessary to confirm this relation. Our model for the SN Ia\nprogenitors then predicts that when the progenitors belong to an older\npopulation or to a low metallicity environment, the number of bright SNe Ia is\nreduced, so that the variation in brightness among the SNe Ia is also smaller.\nThus our model can explain why the mean SN Ia brightness and its dispersion\ndepend on the morphology of the host galaxies and on the distance of the SN\nfrom the center of the galaxy. It is further predicted that at higher redshift\n(z >~ 1) both the the mean brightness of SNe Ia and its variation should be\nsmaller in spiral galaxies than in elliptical galaxies. These variations are\nwithin the range observed in nearby SNe Ia. In so far as the variation in X(C)\nis the most important cause for the diversity among SNe Ia, the light curve\nshape method currently used to determine the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia can\nbe applied also to high redshift SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 1999 17:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 1999 17:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It has a flat rotation\ncurve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply beyond an outer\nedge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model possesses a rich family of\nsimple distribution functions which vary in velocity anisotropy. The model is\nused to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way halo using the latest data on\nthe motions of satellite galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii\ngreater than 20 kpc. This comprises a dataset of 27 objects with known\ndistances and radial velocities, of which 6 also possess measured proper\nmotions. Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum\nlikelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I, provided\nboth radial and proper motion data are used. The availability of the proper\nmotion data for the satellites is crucial as, without them, the mass estimates\nwith and without Leo I are inconsistent at the 99 % confidence level. All these\nresults are derived from models in which the velocity normalisation of the halo\npotential is taken as 220 km/s. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our\nestimate is presented, including the effects of the small dataset, possible\nincompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample and the\nmeasurement errors.

Comparison with previous VLBA\nobservations after a one-year interval shows pronounced changes in the\nstructure and polarization of the jet. Most of the components are found to\nfollow a curved path while undergoing a steepening of their spectra accompanied\nby a decrease in total and polarized emission. However, at least one component\nis observed to follow a quasi-ballistic motion, accompanied by a flattening of\nits spectrum, as well as an increase in total and polarized flux.

Flux lines or\nvortices are induced by fields as small as the Earth's magnetic field. Once\npresent, vortices dissipate energy and generate internal noise, limiting the\noperation of numerous superconducting devices. Methods used to overcome this\ndifficulty include the pinning of vortices by the incorporation of impurities\nand defects, the construction of flux dams, slots and holes and magnetic\nshields which block the penetration of new flux lines in the bulk of the SC or\nreduce the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the superconducting\ndevice. Naturally, the most desirable would be to remove the vortices from the\nbulk of the SC. There is no known phenomenon, however, that could form the\nbasis for such a process. Here we show that the application of an ac current to\na SC that is patterned with an asymmetric pinning potential can induce vortex\nmotion whose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of the pattern. The\nmechanism responsible for this phenomenon is the so called ratchet effect, and\nits working principle applies to both low and high temperature SCs.
