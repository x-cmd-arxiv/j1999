The\nrate obtained is shown to be in good agreement with results from Monte-Carlo\nand N-body simulations. We illustrate the usefulness of this formula by\ncalculating the expected cosmological evolution in the rate of star formation\nthat is due to short-lived, merger-induced starbursts. The calculated evolution\nis well-matched to the observed evolution in ultraviolet luminosity density, in\ncontrast to the lower rates of evolution that are derived from semi-analytic\nmodels that do not include a dominant contribution from starbursts. Hence we\nsuggest that the bulk of the observed ultraviolet starlight at z > 1 arises\nfrom short-lived, merger-induced starbursts.

Similarities between the\ncommunication of SUSY breaking through a messenger sector, and the generation\nof flavor using the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism are exploited, leading to\nthe identification of vector-like messenger fields with FN fields, and the\nmessenger U(1) as a flavor symmetry. An immediate consequence is that the first\nand second generation scalars acquire flavor-dependent masses, but do not\nviolate FCNC bounds since their mass scale, consistent with effective SUSY, is\nof order 10 TeV. We define and advocate a minimal flavor-mediated model (MFMM),\nrecently introduced in the literature, that successfully accommodates the small\nflavor-breaking parameters of the standard model using order one couplings and\nratios of flavon field vevs. The mediation of SUSY breaking occurs via two-loop\nlog-enhanced GM contributions, as well as several one-loop and two-loop\nYukawa-mediated contributions for which we provide analytical expressions.

This\nallows us to classify all the weights of an affine Weyl orbit explicitly. Let\n$\\Lambda$ be a dominant weight of an affine Lie algebra $ G_N^{(r)} $ for\nr=1,2,3. At each and every order M of weight depths, the set $\\wp_M(\\Lambda)$\nof permutation weights is formed out of a finite number of dominant weights of\nthe finite Lie algebra $G_N$. In case of $A_N^{(1)}$ algebras, we give the\nrules to determine the elements of a $\\wp_M(\\Lambda)$ completely. As being a\npositive test of our proposal, we consider the problem of calculating weight\nmultiplicities for affine Lie algebras and hence our discussions are based on\nexplicit computations of Weyl-Kac character formula. It is known that weight\nmultiplicities are provided by string functions which are defined to be formal\npower series $\\sum_{M=0}^\\infty C(M) q^M$ where the order M specifies the depth\nof weights contributing to C(M). In the conventional calculational schemes\nwhich are based on Kac-Peterson form of affine Weyl groups, Weyl-Kac formula\nincludes a sum over a part of the whole root lattice and hence it is seen that\nthe roots of the same length contribute in general to C(M) for several values\nof M. On the contrary, we will determine, for any fixed value of M, the\ncomplete set of weights having depth M and contributing only to C(M). For\napplications of Weyl-Kac formula, one must also know the signatures which\ncorrespond to weights within the Weyl orbits of strictly dominant weights. This\nis given by the aid of a properly defined index. Another emphasis is that the\nway of discussion adopted here gives us a possibility for extensions to other\ninfinite dimensional Lie algebras beyond affine Lie algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 1999 13:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
