In this work, we point out\nthat the double spectral density, when it is determined by successive\napplications of the Borel transformation, contains the spurious terms which\nshould be kept in the subtraction terms in the double dispersion relation. They\nare zero under the Borel transformation but, if the dispersion integral is\nrestricted with QCD duality, they contribute to the continuum. For the simple\ncase with zero external momentum, it is shown that subtracting out the spurious\nterms is equivalent to the QCD sum rules represented by the single dispersion\nrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 1999 05:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2000 00:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
