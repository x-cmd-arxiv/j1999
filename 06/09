First, we have\nconstructed the Fundamental Plane for the 30 E and S0 galaxies and find that it\nhas the following shape: r_e = sigma**(1.31+-0.13) * <I>_e**(-0.86+-0.10),\nsimilar to that found locally. The 1-sigma intrinsic scatter about this plane\nis 14% in M/L(V), comparable to that observed in Coma. We conclude that these E\nand S0 galaxies are structurally mature and homogeneous, like those observed in\nnearby clusters. The M/L(V) ratios of these early-type galaxies are offset from\nthe Coma Fundamental Plane by delta log M/L(V) = -0.13+- 0.03 (q0=0.1),\nindicative of mild luminosity evolution. This evolution suggests a formation\nepoch for the stars of z > 1. We have also analyzed the M/L(V) ratios of\ngalaxies of type S0/a and later. These early-type spirals follow a different\nplane from the E and S0 galaxies, with a scatter that is twice as large as the\nscatter for the E/S0s. The difference in the tilt between the plane of the\nspirals and the plane of the E/S0s is shown to be due to a systematic\ncorrelation of velocity dispersion with residual from the plane of the\nearly-type galaxies. These residuals also correlate with the residuals from the\nColor-Magnitude relation. Thus for spirals in clusters, we see a systematic\nvariation in the luminosity-weighted mean properties of the stellar populations\nwith central velocity dispersion.

Recently, routine\nastrometric follow-up measurements of these source star image centroid shifts\nby using high precision interferometers are proposed to measure the lens proper\nmotion which can resolve the lens parameter degeneracy in the photometrically\ndetermined Einstein time scale. When an event is caused by a bright lens, on\nthe other hand, the astrometric shift is affected by the light from the lens,\nbut one cannot identify the existence of the bright lens from the observed\ntrajectory because the resulting trajectory of the bright lens event is also an\nellipse. As results, lensing parameters determined from the trajectory differ\nfrom those of a dark lens event, causing wrong identification of lens\npopulation. In this paper, we show that although the shape and size of the\nastrometric centroid shift trajectory are changed due to the bright lens, the\nangular speed of centroid shifts around the apparent position of the unlensed\nsource star is not affected by the lens brightness. Then, one can identify the\nexistence of the bright lens and determine its brightness by comparing the lens\nparameters determined from the angular speed curve with those determined from\nthe trajectory of observed centroid shifts. Once the lens brightness is\ndetermined, one can correct for the lens proper motion.

The codes span the range of numerical\ntechniques and implementations currently in use, including SPH and grid methods\nwith fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. The goal of this comparison is to\nassess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters in\nthe simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to\nbe non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at different epochs, global\nproperties such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles\nof various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. On the whole, the\nagreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number of\ndiscrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties of the dark matter and\nworst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even in this case, simulations that\nadequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total X-ray\nluminosities that agree to within a factor of two. Other quantities are\nreproduced to much higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass\nfraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specific\nkinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5%. Various factors\ncontribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, including\ndifferences in the internal timing of the simulations. Based on the overall\nconsistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of the\ncluster we have modelled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 1999 09:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-26"}

Our aim is to\ncontribute to the general theory of nilpotent pairs. Roughly speaking, a\nnilpotent pair (e_1,e_2) consists of two commuting elements in \\g that can\nindependently be contracted to the origin. A principal nilpotent pair is a\ndouble counterpart of a regular nilpotent element. Consequently, the theory of\nnilpotent pairs should stand out as double counterpart of the theory of\nnilpotent orbits. We show that any nilpotent pair has a characteristic\n(h_1,h_2), which is unique within to conjugacy. Generalizing Dynkin's approach\nto (sl_2)-triples, we prove that the number of G-orbits of characteristics of\nnilpotent pairs is finite and provide some estimates for the numerical labels\n\\alpha_j(h_i), where {\\alpha_j} are suitable simple roots of \\g. It was\nobserved by Ginzburg that the number of G-orbits of nilpotent pairs is\ninfinite. This means this class is too wide to have a reasonable theory. To\nresolve this difficulty, we introduce `wonderful' nilpotent pairs. We prove\nthat if two wonderful pairs have the same characteristic, then these are\nconjugate. This implies that there are finitely many G-orbits of wonderful\npairs. A number of nice properties of wonderful pairs shows that these can be\nregarded as right double analogue of nilpotent orbits. We also consider several\nnatural classes of wonderful pairs and describe characteristics for principal\nand almost principal nilpotent pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 1999 17:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Scaling law\nfor transport is characterized by the scaling exponent $q$ and the Hurst\nexponent $H$, as functions of the parameters. The parameter space is divided\ninto regimes of scaling laws of different {\\em functional forms} of the scaling\nexponent and the Hurst exponent. We present the full three-dimensional phase\ndiagram.\n  The limiting process is one of three kinds: Brownian motion ($H=1/2$),\npersistent fractional Brownian motions ($1/2<H<1$) and regular (or smooth)\nmotion (H=1).\n  We discover that a critical wave number divides the infrared cutoffs into\nthree categories, critical, subcritical and supercritical; they give rise to\ndifferent scaling laws and phase diagrams. We introduce the notions of sampling\ndrift and eddy diffusivity, and formulate variational principles to estimate\nthe eddy diffusivity. We show that fractional Brownian motions result from a\ndominant sampling drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 1999 20:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The approach rests on the concept of the substratum - a\nmechanical medium, which occupies all the space and serves as a seat to support\nthe light and to transmit interactions. A turbulent ideal fluid was chosen for\nthe substratum. The turbulence is supposed to be homogeneous and isotropic in\nits ground state. Perturbations of the turbulence model physical fields.\nParticles originate from the voids in the fluid. Symmetrical pairs of\nparticle-antiparticle find analogies in mechanical pairs of\ncyclone-anticyclone. A quantum particle is modeled by the dispersion of a point\ndiscontinuity (defect) in the stochastic medium. Gravitation relates to\nemitting by defects the continual flow of the transient point dilatation. The\nshock wave mechanism of the re-collection a discontinuity in the incompressible\nmedium governs such phenomena as the \"wave function collapse\" and instantaneous\nquantum correlations. Microscopically, the electromagnetic wave and gravitation\nare modeled by the torsional and axisymmetric waves, respectively, in the\nvortex sponge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 1999 02:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
