Within the DMFT the problem is self-consistently mapped onto a set of\ncoupled effective impurity models corresponding to the inequivalent layers\nparallel to the surface. Assuming that the influence of the Hubbard bands on\nthe low-energy quasi-particle resonance can be neglected at the critical point,\na simplified ``linearized DMFT'' becomes possible which is formally equivalent\nto the Weiss molecular-field theory for the semi-infinite Ising model.

Experimentally\none finds the values of some of these observables to be in sharp contrast to\nthe naive (perturbative) theoretical expectations. This indicates that non\nperturbative vacuum properties might play a major role in the comprehension of\nthese phenomena. An example of such a vacuum contribution is the axial anomaly,\nwhich appears in the divergence of the flavor singlet axial current and which\nis connected to the topological properties of QCD. From a field theoretical\npoint of view flavor singlet matrix elements differ from non singlet amplitudes\nin the occurrence of so called disconnected insertions. These are correlations\nof hadron propagators with quark-antiquark loops or correlations between\nquark-antiquark loops, which are mediated by vacuum fluctuations. According to\ntheir respective flavor composition, the disconnected insertions cancel largely\nin non singlet processes, but add in flavor singlet amplitudes. The lattice\napproach provides an ideal tool to study flavor singlet phenomena. Being a\nfirst principle method it should be capable to uncover non perturbative vacuum\ncontributions and to yield, on the long run, reliable results for the size of\nsuch contributions in QCD.
