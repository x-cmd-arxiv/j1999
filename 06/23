The three non-BCGs analyzed also have\nelevated values of S_N, confirming that central location is a primary factor.\nThe number of GCs per unit mass for these fields are consistent with those\nfound in an earlier sample, giving further evidence that GC number scales with\nmass and that the S_N variations are due to a deficit of halo light, i.e., S_N\nreflects mass-to-light ratio.\n  The discussion builds on an earlier suggestion that the GCs (both metal rich\nand metal poor) around the central cluster galaxies were assembled at early\ntimes, and that star formation halted prematurely in the central galaxies at\nthe epoch of cluster collapse. This is consistent with recent simulations of\nBCG/cluster formation. The subsequent addition of luminous material through\ncluster dynamical evolution can cause S_N to decrease, and we may be seeing the\nfirst evidence of this. Finally, the GC luminosity function measurements are\nused to constrain the relative distances of the three clusters that make up the\nHercules supercluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 00:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

And secondly, despite the rather idealised\nnature of these models, the concrete evidence for the occurrence of more than\none type of intermittency in such models makes it in principle possible that\ndifferent types of intermittency may occur in different solar-type stars or\neven in the same star over different epochs. In this way a multiple\nintermittency framework may turn out to be of importance in understanding the\nmechanisms responsible for grand-minima type behaviour in the Sun and\nsolar-type stars and in particular in the interpretation of the corresponding\nobservational and proxy evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 15:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is argued that the quarks and leptons must\nbe protected from gaining a fundamental mass, very large compared to the\nelectroweak scale, by gauge invariance and hence that their gauge charges must\ndepend on handedness. Furthermore we argue that it is the conservation of\nparity in the electromagnetic and strong interactions rather than parity\nviolation in the weak interactions that needs an explanation. We derive this\nparity conservation and indeed the whole system of Weyl fermion representations\nin the Standard Model from a few simple assumptions: Mass protection, small\nrepresentations, anomaly cancellation and the Standard Model gauge group\n$S(U(2)\\times U(3))$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 13:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our motivation for studying polarization\nobservables is threefold. First, polarization observables are more effective\ndiscriminators of subtle dynamics than the unpolarized cross section. Second,\nearlier nonrelativistic calculations suggest an almost complete insensitivity\nof polarization observables to distortions effects. Finally, this insensitivity\nentails an enormous simplification in the theoretical treatment. Indeed, by\nintroducing the notion of a ``bound-nucleon propagator'' we exploit Feynman's\ntrace techniques to develop closed-form, analytic expressions for all\nphotoproduction observables. Moreover, our results indicate that polarization\nobservables are also insensitive to relativistic effects and to the nuclear\ntarget. Yet, they are sensitive to the model parameters, making them ideal\ntools for the study of modifications to the elementary amplitude --- such as in\nthe production, propagation, and decay of nucleon resonances --- in the nuclear\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 14:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

More\nindependent determinations of line widths for multiply-ionized non-hydrogenic\nions are called for, but meanwhile caution should be exercised in the use of\ncorresponding semiclassically calculated widths, e.g., in opacity calculations\nor for plasma density diagnostics.

There exists a wealth of numerical\ninvestigations of globally coupled maps. While much progress has been made in\nthe explanation of the macroscopic behaviour of such systems in the limit of\ninfinite N, there is still need for a sound theory about the asymptotic\nbehaviour of finite-N systems as N approaches infinity. This article introduces\na method by which it is possible to obtain asymptotic estimates for long-term\ndeviations from the thermodynamic limit behaviour. This method is based upon\nthe concept of quasipotentials, originally developed by Freidlin, Wentzell, and\nothers for describing the influence of small random perturbations on the\nlong-term behaviour of dynamical systems. The problems of explicitly computing\nquasipotentials in the present context and potential approximation schemes are\ndiscussed. All the concepts described in this article are illustrated with a\nsimple example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 14:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
