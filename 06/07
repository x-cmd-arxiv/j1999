In particular, we investigate the effects of synchrotron self\nabsorption and energy injection. A shock in a dense medium becomes\nnonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. The afterglow from\nthe shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the\nrelativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predict that a\nstrongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during the formation of GRB,\nwe discuss the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic\nshock through magnetic dipole radiation. We find that after the energy which\nthe shock obtains from the pulsar is much more than the initial energy of the\nshock, the afterglow decay will flatten significantly. When the pulsar energy\ninput effect disappears, the decay will steepen again. These features are in\nexcellent agreement with the afterglows of GRB 980519, GRB 990510 and GRB\n980326.

The proposed stochastic\nunravelling is based on a description of the reduced system in a doubled\nHilbert space and it is shown, that this method is capable of simulating\nquantum master equations with negative transition rates. Non-Markovian effects\nin the reduced systems dynamics can be treated within this approach by\nemploying the time-convolutionless projection operator technique. This ansatz\nyields a systematic perturbative expansion of the reduced systems dynamics in\nthe coupling strength. Several examples such as the damped Jaynes Cummings\nmodel and the spontaneous decay of a two-level system into a photonic band gap\nare discussed. The power as well as the limitations of the method are\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 1999 09:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
