This\ngives rise to a forward shock that moves into the outer shell producing a bump\nin the afterglow light curve of amplitude roughly proportional to the ratio of\nthe energy in the inner and the outer shells. In addition, a reverse shock\npropagates in the inner shell and produces emission at a characteristic\nfrequency that is typically much smaller than the peak of the emission from the\nouter shell by a factor of $\\sim 7 \\gamma_{0c}^2 (E_2/E_1)^{1.1}$, and the\nobserved flux at this frequency from the reverse shock is larger compared to\nthe flux from the outer shell by a factor of $\\sim 8 (\\gamma_{0c}\nE_2/E_1)^{5/3} $; where $\\gamma_{0c}$ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the outer\nshell at the time of collision, and $E_1 & E_2$ are the total energy in the\nouter and the inner shells respectively.

Special relativity shows that `before' and `after'\nare relative, and quantum measurement is even more subtle. Since the\nnonlocality of Bell's theorem, it has been known that quantum measurement has\nan uneasy relation with special relativity, described by Shimony as `peaceful\ncoexistence'. Hardy's theorem says that quantum measurement requires a\npreferred Lorentz frame. The original proofs of the theorem depended on there\nbeing no backward causality, even at the quantum level. In quant-ph/9803044\nthis condition was removed. It was only required that systems with classical\ninputs and outputs had no causal loops. Here the conditions are weakened\nfurther: there should be no forbidden causal loops as defined in the text. The\ntheory depends on a transfer function analysis, which is introduced in detail\nbefore application to specific systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 1999 14:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 1999 13:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
