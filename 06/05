However, perturbations are usually represented by fields on the\nbackground spacetime, and expanded at different orders into contributions that\nmay or may not be gauge independent. We show that perturbations of scalar\nquantities are observable if they are first order gauge-invariant, even if they\nare gauge dependent at higher order. Gauge invariance to first order plays\ntherefore an important conceptual role in the theory, for it selects the\nperturbations with direct physical meaning from those having only a\nmathematical status.

We show that the same remains true in the\nnear-horizon limit, for BPS probes only, with the BPS probe moving from AdS\ninfinity to the horizon. This is a quantitative indication that the brane-probe\nreaching the horizon corresponds to thermalization in gauge theory.
