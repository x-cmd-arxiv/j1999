The Br-alpha spectra show the classical ring-like\nsignature of quasi-spherical expansion, with weak blueshifted emission (V_max\napprox -60 km/s) and strong redshifted emission (V_max approx +10 km/s), where\nthe velocities are with respect to the velocity of the Pistol Star; further,\nthe redshifted emission appears to be \"flattened\" in the position-velocity\ndiagram.

The neutrino spectrum depends on the thermodynamic conditions of the\ncore, the nuclear abundances, the lepton fractions and relevant nuclear\nproperties. In the pre-trapping core of a core-collapse supernova, the density\nranges from $0.1 - 100~10^{10}$ g/cm$^3$ and the temperature from $0.2 - 1.5$\nMeV. The nuclear abundances as well as the electron capture rates are thus\ndetermined, among other things, by the nuclear binding energies and the free\nnucleon chemical potentials. Because shell and pairing effects persist strongly\nup to temperatures of $\\simeq 0.5$ MeV, any equation of state (EOS) relevant to\nthis phase of the collapse must reproduce well the zero temperature nuclear\nproperties and it must show a smooth transition to the known high temperature\nand high density limits.

Our main results are: a) the\nHI morphology is irregular and perturbed, gathered in three blobs apparently\nunrelated to the optical morphology; b) the observed HI velocity distribution\nindicates a normal disk in differential rotation with a constant velocity out\nto a radius of 160'' (30 kpc), c) the inclination of the disk is about 25 deg\nwith the kinematic major axis at a position angle slightly different from that\nof the stellar bar, d) the HI mass inside a radius of 18'' is only 2.1 10^7\nMsun, the total HI mass within 180'' is 1.1 10^9 Msun and the dynamical mass is\n2 10^{11} Msun. The bulk of the gas in NGC 3783 is outside the diameter of the\nstellar bar; e) Numerical simulations of the gas flow in the barred potential\nderived from the red image indicate that the pattern speed is Omega_p = 38\nkm/s/kpc: the ring of Halpha emitting regions encircling the bar would then\ncorrespond to UHR, and the Halpha accumulation in the center to a nuclear ring.\nVarious possibilities are discussed to account for the active nucleus fuelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 1999 07:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

With these simple assumptions, our model\nnot only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also\nreproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and\nblack hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar\npopulation with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby\nquasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number\ndensity of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects:\ni) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas\navailable to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas\naccretion.

Far above threshold, the stationary\nstate $\\rho_{ss}$ of the laser mode is a mixture of coherent field states with\nrandom phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. This\npaper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of $\\rho_{ss}$ as a\nstationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? An ensemble of pure\nstates for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing\nthe dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time\nthat the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such\nknowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is\ncoupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation.\nUsing a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the\nphysically realizable (PR) ensembles. We find that for any finite self-energy\n$\\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, the coherent state ensemble is not PR;\nthe closest one can come to it is an ensemble of squeezed states. This is\nparticularly relevant for atom lasers, where the self-energy arising from\nelastic collisions is expected to be large. By contrast, the number state\nensemble is always PR. As $\\chi$ increases, the states in the PR ensemble\nclosest to the coherent state ensemble become increasingly squeezed.\nNevertheless, there are values of $\\chi$ for which states with well-defined\ncoherent amplitudes are PR, even though the atom laser is not coherent (in the\nsense of having a Bose-degenerate output).
