For GRB\n980326, we derive a power-law decay exponent alpha = -1.7, taking into account\nthe new upper limit for the host as R > 27.3 provided by Bloom and Kulkarni\n(1998). This implies one of the fastest GRB optical decays ever measured. The\nfact that only about 50% of optical transients have been found within the\ngamma/X-ray error boxes, suggest that either considerable intrinsic absorption\nis present or that some optical transients display a very fast decline. We also\npropose that the secondary maximum detected on 17 Apr 1998 could be explained\nin the context of the SN-like light curves 2-3 weeks after the GRB, as recently\nsuggested by Woosley (1999).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 1999 08:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this manner, collision\nintegrals for Boltzmann equations are obtained as correlators of fluctuations.\nThe formalism is applied to a hot non-Abelian plasma close to equilibrium. We\nintegrate-out explicitly the fluctuations with typical momenta of the Debye\nmass, and obtain the collision integral in a leading logarithmic approximation.\nWe also identify a source for stochastic noise. The resulting dynamical\nequations are of the Boltzmann-Langevin type. While our approach is based on\nclassical physics, we also give the necessary generalizations to study the\nquantum plasmas. Ultimately, the dynamical equations for soft and ultra-soft\nfields change only in the value for the Debye mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 1999 20:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
