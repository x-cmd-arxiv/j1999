We attempt to reproduce the observed trend of\nthe F-J residuals with age using two simple models. The first assumes that\ngalaxy age is tracing the last major star formation event in an elliptical\ngalaxy. The fading of this burst changes the M_B component of the F-J\nresiduals, with time. Such a model was very successful at reproducing the B-V\nand Mg_2 evolution reported in our previous paper, but is unable to reproduce\nthe strength of the F-J trend. A second model is required to describe\nage-correlated changes in galaxy dynamics. Following expectations from\ncosmological simulations, we assume that the velocity dispersion, for a galaxy\nof a given mass, scales with the epoch of galaxy formation, i.e. with the mean\ndensity of the Universe. Hence recently formed ellipticals have systematically\nlower velocity dispersions than old ellipticals. We find that a combination of\nthese two models provides a good match to the change in F-J residuals with\ngalaxy age. This suggests that young ellipticals will have subtly different\ndynamical properties to old ellipticals.

In\naddition to nonlinear wave-mixing between matter waves, we also discuss the\ndynamical interplay between optical and matter waves. This new paradigm, which\nis now within experimental reach, has the potential to impact a number of\nfields of physics, including the manipulation and applications of atomic\ncoherence, and the preparation of quantum entanglement between microscopic and\nmacroscopic systems. Possible applications include quantum information\nprocessing, matter-wave holography, and nanofabrication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1999 21:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show a\nnew inequality between the error of the first kind and the second kind, which\ncomplements the result of Hiai and Petz to establish the quantum version of\nStein's lemma. The inequality is also used to show a bound on the first kind\nerror when the power exponent for the second kind error exceeds the quantum\nrelative entropy, and the bound yields the strong converse in the quantum\nhypothesis testing. Finally, we discuss the relation between the bound and the\npower exponent derived by Han and Kobayashi in the classical hypothesis\ntesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 1999 08:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
