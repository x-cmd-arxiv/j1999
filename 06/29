Thus, it is essential that these properties be represented in a\nlanguage that is easy to use and sufficiently expressive.\n  Linear-time temporal logic is a formalism that has been extensively used by\nresearchers for specifying properties of systems. When such properties are\nclosed under stuttering, i.e. their interpretation is not modified by\ntransitions that leave the system in the same state, verification tools can\nutilize a partial-order reduction technique to reduce the size of the model and\nthus analyze larger systems.
