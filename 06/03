Slow growth of a black hole in a pre-existing\ncore produces a steep power-law density profile similar to the cusps seen in\nfaint elliptical galaxies. The weaker cusps in bright ellipticals may result\nfrom ejection of stars by a coalescing black-hole binary; there is marginal\nkinematical evidence for such a process having occurred in M87. Stellar orbits\nin a triaxial nucleus are mostly regular at radii where the gravitational force\nis dominated by the black hole; however the orbital shapes are not conducive to\nreinforcing the triaxial figure, hence nuclei are likely to be approximately\naxisymmetric. In triaxial potentials, a ``zone of chaos'' extends outward to a\nradius where the enclosed stellar mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the\nblack hole; in this chaotic zone, no regular, box-like orbits exist. At larger\nradii, the phase space in triaxial potentials is complex, consisting of\nstochastic orbits as well as regular orbits associated with stable resonances.\nFigure rotation tends to increase the degree of stochasticity. Both\ntest-particle integrations and N-body simulations suggest that a triaxial\ngalaxy responds globally to the presence of a central mass concentration by\nevolving toward more axisymmetric shapes; the evolution occurs rapidly when the\nmass of the central object exceeds roughly 2% of the mass in stars. The lack of\nsignificant triaxiality in most early-type galaxies may be a consequence of\norbital evolution induced by nuclear black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 1999 20:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This technique yields a gaussian diameter which\nsubsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to obtain the true\nangular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a function of the\nFull Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the beam. It also depends on the intrinsic\nsurface brightness distribution of the source.\n  In this paper the theory behind this technique will be studied. This study\nwill be restricted to circularly symmetric geometries and beams. First an\nimplicit equation will be derived, from which the conversion factor for a given\nsurface brightness distribution and beam size can be solved. Explicit\nexpressions for the conversion factor will be derived from this equation which\nare valid in cases where the beam size is larger than the intrinsic size of the\nsource. A more detailed discussion will be given for two simple geometries: a\ncircular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical constant emissivity\nshell with arbitrary inner radius. The theory is subsequently used to construct\na new technique for determining the FWHM of an arbitrary observed surface\nbrightness distribution.\n  Usually the FWHM of the source and beam are measured using gaussian fits, but\nsecond moments can also be used. The alternative use of second moments in this\ncontext is studied here for the first time and it is found that in this case\nthe conversion factor has a different value which is independent of the beam\nsize.
