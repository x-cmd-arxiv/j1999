The\nmodels are based on the latest evolutionary tracks for hydrogen burning\npost-AGB stars. For such tracks the evolutionary rate is very dependent on the\nassumed mass loss rate as a function of time. We investigate this effect by\nmodifying the mass loss prescription. The newly calculated evolutionary rates\nand density distributions are used to model the spectral evolution of a\npost-AGB star with the photo-ionization code Cloudy, including dust in the\nradiative transfer. Different assumptions for the dust properties and dust\nformation are considered. It is shown that by varying these parameters in a\nreasonable way, entirely different paths are followed in the IRAS colour-colour\ndiagram. First of all, the effects of the evolution of the central star on the\nexpanding dust shell can not be neglected. Also the dust properties and the\ndefinition of the end of the AGB phase have an important effect. The model\ntracks show that objects occupying the same location in the IRAS colour-colour\ndiagram can have a different evolutionary past, and therefore the position in\nthe IRAS colour-colour diagram alone can not a priori give a unique\ndetermination of the evolutionary status of an object. An alternative\ncolour-colour diagram, the K-[12] vs. [12]-[25] diagram, is presented.
