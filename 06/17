We also also develop a kind of\ngeneralised character theory which gives good information about the\nrationalisation of C(E,G). In the few cases that we have been able to analyse\ncompletely, either C(E,G) is rationally different from E^0BG for easy\ncharacter-theoretic reasons, or we have C(E,G)=E^0BG.\n  Rather than working directly with rings, we will study the formal schemes\nX(G)=spf(E^0BG) and XCh(G)=spf(C(E,G)). Suitably interpreted, our main\ndefinition is that XCh(G) is the scheme of homomorphisms from the\nLambda-semiring R^+(G) of complex representations of G to the Lambda-semiring\nscheme of divisors on the formal group associated to E.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 1999 16:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We assume that the integral\ncurvature is finite. For radially symmetric $K$ we introduce the notion of a\nleast integrally curved surface, and also the notion of when such a surface is\ncritical. With respect to these notions we analyze the radial symmetry of $u$\nfor the whole spectrum of possible integral curvature values. Under a mild\nintegrability condition which rules out harmonic non-radial behavior near\ninfinity, we prove that $u$ is radially symmetric and decreasing in the\nfollowing categories: (1) $K$ is decreasing, $u$ a classical solution, and the\nintegral curvature of the surface is above critical; (2) $K$ is decreasing, $u$\na classical solution, the integral curvature of the surface is critical, and\nthe surface satisfies an additional integrability condition which is mildly\nstronger than finite integral curvature; (3) $K$ is non-positive. In categories\n1 and 2, $K$ is allowed to diverge logarithmically or as power law to $-\\infty$\nat spatial infinity. Examples of nonradial solutions which violate one or more\nof our conditions are discussed as well. In particular, for non-positive and\nnon-negative $K$ that satisfy appropriate integrability conditions and\notherwise are fairly arbitrary, we introduce probabilistic methods to construct\nsurfaces with finite integral curvature and entire harmonic asymptotics at\ninfinity. For radial symmetric $K$ these surfaces are examples of broken\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 1999 20:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2000 00:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
