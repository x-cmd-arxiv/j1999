An analytic solution of the accretion-disk\nstructure is obtained for this scenario by using classical equations. An\nattempt is made to construct a model for nonconservative supercritical\naccretion with advection. To this end, we develop a numerical scheme for\ncalculating the structure of an advective disk with mass outflow. The goal of\nsolving the problem of a supercritical disk with mass loss is to explain\naccreting sources with outflowing envelopes, for example, SS 433 and galactic\nnuclei. The structure and observational manifestations of the envelope which\nforms around a supercritical disk are considered by taking into account\nbremsstrahlung absorption and Thomson scattering of photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 14:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The presence of an accretion disk in this blazar object, likely\nobservable only in very low states and otherwise hidden by the beamed, variable\nsynchrotron component, would be consistent with the scenario in which the seed\nphotons for the inverse Compton mechanism producing the gamma-rays are external\nto the relativistic jet.

It is based usually on\nsingle-photon polarization states. Unfortunately, the implemented ``qubits'' in\nthe usual weak pulse experiments are not true two-level systems, and quantum\nkey distribution based on these imperfect qubits is totally insecure in the\npresence of high (realistic) loss rate. In this work, we investigate another\npotential implementation: qubits generated using a process of parametric\ndownconversion. We find that, to first (two-photon) and second (four-photon)\norder in the parametric downconversion small parameter, this implementation of\nquantum key distribution is equivalent to the theoretical version.\n  Once realistic measurements are taken into account, quantum key distribution\nbased on parametric downconversion suffers also from sensitivity to extremely\nhigh (nonrealistic) losses. By choosing the small parameter of the process\naccording to the loss rates, both implementations of quantum key distribution\ncan in principle become secure against the attack studied in this paper.\nHowever, adjusting the small parameter to the required levels seems to be\nimpractical in the weak pulse process. On the other hand, this can easily be\ndone in the parametric downconversion process, making it a much more promising\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1999 07:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}
