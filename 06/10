However,\nthe derived value of the Hubble constant is significantly different from the\nvalue derived from the FGSE model. We find that the value of the Hubble\nconstant is given by H_0 = 69 +18/-12 (1-K) and 74 +18/-17 (1-K) km/s/Mpc with\nand without a constraint on the cluster's mass, respectively, where K is the\nconvergence of the cluster at the position of the galaxy and the range for each\nvalue is defined by Delta chi-squared = reduced chi-squared. Presently, the\nbest achievable fit for this system is not as good as for PG 1115+080, which\nalso has recently been used to constrain the Hubble constant, and the\ndegeneracy is large. Possibilities for improving the fit and reducing the\ndegeneracy are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 1999 02:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This\ninterpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the magnitude\nof the static tension and of the B-I charge; and Polchinski's mixed\nDirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string.\nThe latter arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion.\nAlso, the Born-Infeld charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole\nradiation under the influence of harmonic oscillations of the string.

The\nmanifest invariances are achieved by means of the PST-mechanism. The dynamics\nfor classical point particles is described by an action functional living on a\ncircle, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition for electric and magnetic\ncharges holds. The inconsistent classical field theory depends on an arbitrary,\nbut fixed, external vector field, a generalization of the Dirac-string.\nNevertheless, the Quantum Field Theory, obtained from this classical action via\na functional integral approach, turns out to be independent of the particular\nvector field chosen, and thus consistent, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization\ncondition holds. We provide explicit expressions for the generating functionals\nof observables, proving that they are Dirac-string independent. Since\nLorentz-invariance is manifest at each step, the quantum theory admits also a\nmanifestly diffeomorphism invariant coupling to external gravity. Relations\nwith previous formulations, and with SO(2)--non invariant theories are\nclarified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 1999 13:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These\nconditions appear to exclude two certain flatness of M and of M'. From the\npoint of view of CR geometry, a real analytic CR manifold M can be flat in\nessentially to ways, being biholomorphic to a product M_1\\times \\Delta^k, k\\geq\n1, by a polydisc (algebraic degeneracy), or to a product M_1\\times I^l,l\\geq 1\nby a real cube (transversal degeneracy), in a neighborhod of a Zariski generic\npoint.

While all relativistic\nmodels give a reasonable description of spin-orbit splittings, all\nnon-relativistic models show a wrong trend with mass number. The spin-orbit\nsplitting of heavy nuclei might be overestimated by 40%-80%.
