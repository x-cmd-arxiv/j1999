Respecting the symmetries of the electronic Ham iltonian\nin the presence of a magnetic field, we represent this Hamiltonian as a matrix\nwith res pect to a two-particle basis composed of one-particle states of a\nGaussian basis set. The corresponding generalized eigenvalue problem is solved\nnumerically, providing in the present paper results for vanish ing magnetic\nquantum number M=0 and even or odd z-parity, each for both singlet and triplet\nspin symmetry. Total electronic energies of the ground state and the first few\nexcitations in each su bspace as well as their one-electron ionization energies\nare presented as a function of the magnetic fie ld, and their behaviour is\ndiscussed. Energy values for electromagnetic transitions within the M=0 sub\nspace are shown, and a complete table of wavelengths at all the detected\nstationary points with respect to their field dependence is given, thereby\nproviding a basis for a comparison with observed ab sorption spectra of\nmagnetic white dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 1999 08:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In general the importance of the\nexchange energy to the binding properties of at oms or molecules increases\nstrongly with increasing field strength. This is due to the spin-flip\ntransitions and in particular due to the contributions of the tightly bound\nhydrogenic state s which are involved in the corresponding ground states of\ndifferent symmetries. In contrast to the exchange energy the correlation energy\nbecomes less relevant with increasing field strength. This holds for the\nindividual configurations constituting the ground state and for the crossovers\nof the global ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 1999 08:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
