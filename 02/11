The method\nallows to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional Fourier\ntransform and to extract dynamical information from quantum spectra which has\nbeen unattainable before, such as bifurcations of orbits, the uncovering of\nhidden ghost orbits in complex phase space, and the direct observation of\nsymmetry breaking effects. The method also solves the fundamental convergence\nproblems in semiclassical periodic orbit theories - for both the Berry-Tabor\nformula and Gutzwiller's trace formula - and can therefore be applied as a\nnovel technique for periodic orbit quantization, i.e., to calculate\nsemiclassical eigenenergies from a finite set of classical periodic orbits. The\nadvantage of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion is the\nuniversality and wide applicability of the method, which will be demonstrated\nin this work for various open and bound systems with underlying regular,\nchaotic, and even mixed classical dynamics. The efficiency of the method is\nincreased, i.e., the number of orbits required for periodic orbit quantization\nis reduced, when the harmonic inversion technique is generalized to the\nanalysis of cross-correlated periodic orbit sums. The method provides not only\nthe eigenenergies and resonances of systems but also allows the semiclassical\ncalculation of diagonal matrix elements and, e.g., for atoms in external\nfields, individual non-diagonal transition strengths. Furthermore, it is\npossible to include higher order terms of the hbar expanded periodic orbit sum\nto obtain semiclassical spectra beyond the Gutzwiller and Berry-Tabor\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 1999 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The Wall formula for the calculation of friction in\nnuclear physics and the Drude formula for the calculation of conductivity in\nmesoscopic physics can be regarded as two special results of the general\nformulation. We assume a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(Q,P;x(t))$ with\n$x(t)=Vt$, where $V$ is slow in a classical sense. The rate-of-change $V$ is\nnot necessarily slow in the quantum-mechanical sense. Dissipation means an\nirreversible systematic growth of the (average) energy. It is associated with\nthe stochastic spreading of energy across levels. The latter can be\ncharacterized by a transition probability kernel $P_t(n|m)$ where $n$ and $m$\nare level indices. This kernel is the main object of the present study. In the\nclassical limit, due to the (assumed) chaotic nature of the dynamics, the\nsecond moment of $P_t(n|m)$ exhibits a crossover from ballistic to diffusive\nbehavior. We define the $V$ regimes where either perturbation theory or\nsemiclassical considerations are applicable in order to establish this\ncrossover in the quantal case. In the limit $\\hbar\\to 0$ perturbation theory\ndoes not apply but semiclassical considerations can be used in order to argue\nthat there is detailed correspondence, during the crossover time. In the\nperturbative regime there is a lack of such correspondence. Namely, $P_t(n|m)$\nis characterized by a perturbative core-tail structure that persists during the\ncrossover time. In spite of this lack of (detailed) correspondence there may be\nstill a restricted correspondence as far as the second-moment is concerned.\nSuch restricted correspondence is essential in order to establish the universal\nfluctuation-dissipation relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 1999 14:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 1999 17:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2000 14:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We construct an explicit procedure which demonstrates that for bi-partite\npure states, in the asymptotic limit, entanglement can be concentrated or\ndiluted with vanishing classical communication cost. Entanglement of bi-partite\npure states is thus established as a truly inter-convertible resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 1999 18:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 1999 12:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
