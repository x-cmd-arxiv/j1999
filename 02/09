In order to classify VES 735, we have constructed\nan atlas of stellar spectra of O stars in the yellow-green (4800 - 5420 A). We\ncalibrate spectral type versus the line ratio HeI 4922:HeII 5411, showing that\nthis ratio should be useful for the classification of heavily reddened O stars\nassociated with HII regions.\n  Application to VES 735 shows that the spectral type is O8.5. The absolute\nmagnitude suggests luminosity class V. Comparison of the rateof emission of\nionizing photons and the bolometric luminosity of VES 735, inferred from radio\nand infrared measurements of the KR 140 region, to recent stellar models gives\nconsistent evidence for a main sequence star of mass 25 M_sun and age less than\na few million years with a covering factor 0.4 - 0.5 by the nebular material.\n  Spectra taken in the red (6500 - 6700 A) show that the stellar H-alpha\nemission is double-peaked about the systemic velocity and slightly variable.\nH-beta is in absorption, so that the emission-line classification is ``(e)''.\nHowever, unlike the case of the more well known O(e) star Zeta Oph, the\nemission from VES 735 appears to be long-lived rather than episodic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 1999 16:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The continuous-variable teleportation protocol by Braunstein and\nKimble [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 80}, 869 (1998)] for teleporting the quantum\nstate of a single mode of the electromagnetic field is generalized for the case\nof a multimode field with finite bandwith. We discuss criteria for\ncontinuous-variable teleportation with various sets of input states and apply\nthem to the teleportation of broadband fields. We first consider as a set of\ninput fields (from which an independent state preparer draws the inputs to be\nteleported) arbitrary pure Gaussian states with unknown coherent amplitude\n(squeezed or coherent states). This set of input states, further restricted to\nan alphabet of coherent states, was used in the experiment by Furusawa {\\it et\nal.} [Science {\\bf 282}, 706 (1998)]. It requires unit-gain teleportation for\noptimizing the teleportation fidelity. In our broadband scheme, the excess\nnoise added through unit-gain teleportation due to the finite degree of the\nsqueezed-state entanglement is just twice the (entanglement) source's squeezing\nspectrum for its ``quiet quadrature.'' The teleportation of one half of an\nentangled state (two-mode squeezed vacuum state), i.e., ``entanglement\nswapping,'' and its verification are optimized under a certain nonunit gain\ncondition. We will also give a broadband description of this\ncontinuous-variable entanglement swapping based on the single-mode scheme by\nvan Loock and Braunstein [Phys. Rev.
