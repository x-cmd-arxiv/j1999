The expected gravitational waves\nlogarithmic energy spectra are tilted towards high frequencies and\ncharacterized by two parameters: the inflationary curvature scale at which the\ntransition to the stiff phase occurs and the number of (non conformally\ncoupled) scalar degrees of freedom whose decay into fermions triggers the onset\nof a gravitational reheating of the Universe. Depending upon the parameters of\nthe model and upon the different inflationary dynamics (prior to the onset of\nthe stiff evolution) the relic gravitons energy density can be much more\nsizeable than in standard inflationary models, for frequencies larger than 1\nHz. We estimate the required sensitivity for detection of the predicted\nspectral amplitude and show that the allowed region of our parameter space\nleads to a signal smaller (by one 1.5 orders of magnitude) than the advanced\nLIGO sensitivity at a frequency of 0.1 KHz. The maximal signal, in our context,\nis expected in the GHz region where the energy density of relic gravitons in\ncritical units (i.e. $h_0^2 \\Omega_{GW}$) is of the order of $10^{-6}$, roughly\neight orders of magnitude larger than in ordinary inflationary models.

In general, the surface of chi^2 shows\nextremely complicated behavior over the 9-parameter space that characterizes\nbinary lenses. This makes it difficult to systematically search the space and\nverify that a given local minimum is a global minimum. We show that for events\nwith well-monitored caustics, the caustic-crossing region can be isolated from\nthe rest of the light curve and easily fit to a 5-parameter function. Four of\nthese caustic-crossing parameters can then be used to constrain the search in\nthe larger 9-parameter space. This allows a systematic search for all solutions\nand thus identification of all local minima. We illustrate this technique using\nthe PLANET data for MACHO 98-SMC-1, an excellent and publicly available\ncaustic-crossing data set. We show that a very broad range of parameter\ncombinations are compatible with the PLANET data set, demonstrating that\nobservations of binary-lens lightcurves with sampling of only one caustic\ncrossing do not yield unique solutions. The corollary to this is that the time\nof the second caustic crossing cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of\nearly data including the first caustic crossing alone.

The coherent\npotential approximation is employed to handle the randomness. The adsorbate\nself-energy is evaluated explicitly using the density of states for the\nsubstrate band. This takes us beyond the conventional wide-band approximation\nand removes the logarithmic divergence associated with the binding energy\ncalculations. The formalism is applied to the electrosorption of copper ion on\ngold electrode, and the coverage dependence of adsorbate charge, binding\nenergy, and adsorbate density of states are determined. The analysis predicts a\nunique charge configuration of copper adsorbate, having a net positive charge,\nin the high-coverage regime, and multiple charge states when the coverage is\nlow. Though one of the charge configurations of copper is nearly neutral at\nsmall coverage, its positive charge state is the most stable in the entire\ncoverage range. The transition from the relative neutral state of copper at low\ncoverage to a positive charge configuration occurs sharply at the\nintermediate-coverage region. This transition is caused due to the progressive\ndesolvation of copper adion with increasing coverage. The energy calculations\nshow that copper s-orbital bonding contributes maximally toward the binding\nenergy at the metal-vacuum interface, whereas it is the copper d-orbital\nbonding which makes chemisorption feasible at the gold electrode. Finally, our\nnumerical results are compared with the relevant experimental studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 1999 06:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
