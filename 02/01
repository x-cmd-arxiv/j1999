While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a\nsquare-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the\nderived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would\nbe required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However,\nwe offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of\nstructures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an\nalgorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules --\nrules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the\nresulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full\ntreebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted\ngrammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the\ncompaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which\nis argued to be more linguistically motivated. Combined with simple\nthresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size\nwithout significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69%\nreduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 1999 18:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The problem of nonlocality appears in the obtainment of the\nspectrum of the theory.

Making extensive use of the method of\ndispersion integrals we calculate the full polarization propagator not only for\nreal energies in the spacelike and timelike regime but also in the whole\ncomplex energy plane. The latter proved to be necessary in order to identify\nunphysical causality violating poles which are the consequence of a neglection\nof vacuum polarization. On the contrary it is shown that Dirac sea effects\nstabilize the nuclear matter system shifting the unphysical pole from the upper\nenergy plane back to the real axis. The exchange of strength between these real\ntimelike collective excitations and the spacelike energy regime is shown to\nlead to a reduction of the quasielastic peak as it is seen in electron\nscattering experiments. Neglecting vacuum polarization one also obtains a\nreduction of the quasielastic peak but in this case the strength is partly\nshifted to the causality violating pole mentioned above which consequently\ncannot be considered as a physical reliable result.
