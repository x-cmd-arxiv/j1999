As well known the ground state of a given Hamiltonian $H$\ncan be obtained by applying the imaginary time propagator $e^{-H \\tau}$ to a\ngiven trial state $\\psi_T$ for large imaginary time $\\tau$ and sampling\nstatistically the propagated state $ \\psi_{\\tau} = e^{-H \\tau} \\psi_T$. However\nthe so called ``sign problem'' may appear in the simulation and such\nstatistical propagation would be practically impossible without employing some\napproximation such as the well known ``fixed node'' approximation (FN). This\nmethod allows to improve the FN dynamic with a systematic correction scheme.\nThis is possible by the simple requirement that, after a short imaginary time\npropagation via the FN dynamic, a number $p$ of correlation functions can be\nfurther constrained to be {\\em exact} by small perturbation of the FN\npropagated state, which is free of the sign problem. By iterating this scheme\nthe Monte Carlo average sign, which is almost zero when there is sign problem,\nremains stable and finite even for large $\\tau$. The proposed algorithm is\ntested against the exact diagonalization results available on finite lattice.\nIt is also shown in few test cases that the dependence of the results upon the\nfew parameters entering the stochastic technique can be very easily controlled,\nunless for exceptional cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 1999 10:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
