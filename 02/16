These clusters will help\ndetermine the profile and shape of the inner halo. To aid this effort, we\npresent two methods of mass determination: one, a generalization of\nrotation-curve mass measurements, which gives the mass and potential from\ncomplete position-velocity observations for stream stars; and another using a\nsimple chi^2 estimator, which can be used when only projected positions and\nradial velocities are known for stream stars. We illustrate the use of the\nlatter method using simulated tidal streams from Pal 5 and find that fairly\naccurate mass determinations are possible even for relatively poor data sets.\nFollow-up observations of clusters with proper motion determinations may reveal\ntidal streams; obtaining radial velocity measurements would enable accurate\nmeasurements of the mass distribution in the inner Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 1999 14:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 1999 16:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Due to the small\nmass difference between the lambda-hyperon and its decay products---a nucleon\nand a pion---the mesonic component of the decay is strongly Pauli blocked in\nthe nuclear medium. Thus, the in-medium decay becomes dominated by the\nnon-mesonic, or two-body, component of the decay. For this mode, the\nlambda-hyperon decays into a nucleon and a spacelike nuclear excitation. In\nthis work we concentrate exclusively on the pion-like modes. By relying on the\nanalytic structure of the nucleon and pion propagators, we express the\nnon-mesonic component of the decay in terms of the spin-longitudinal response\nfunction. This response has been constrained from precise quasielastic (p,n)\nmeasurements done at LAMPF. We compute the spin-longitudinal response in a\nrelativistic random-phase-approximation model that reproduces accurately the\nquasielastic data. By doing so, we obtain hypernuclear decay widths that are\nconsiderably smaller---by factors of two or three---relative to existing\nnonrelativistic calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 1999 17:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
