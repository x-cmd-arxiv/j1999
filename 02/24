The data\nfrom the Low Energy and Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometers (LECS & MECS)\nonboard BeppoSAX allow studying the spectrum of this star from 0.1 to 8 keV,\nconfirming that this is a very active coronal source, with strong flaring\nactivity. The X-ray emission most likely originates from the eclipsing binary\nitself, rather than from the other visual component of the system. The X-ray\nlight curves could be modulated with the orbital period of the eclipsing\nbinary, with a hint for a different orbital modulation of the cooler and hotter\nplasma. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by hot plasma, with the Fe K\ncomplex at 6.7 keV clearly detected in the MECS spectrum, and it is well fitted\nby a 2-temperature optically thin plasma model with low metal abundances ($\\sim\n0.3 Z_\\odot$). These results are in line with those found for many other active\nstars. As expected, during the flare the X-ray emission is dominated by hotter\nplasma with a temperature $> 4$ keV.

For this purpose, the\nlow-temperature evolution of the high-frequency wing of the dielectric loss\npeaks is investigated in detail.

EMQG is manifestly compatible with Cellular\nAutomata (CA) theory, and is based on a new theory of inertia proposed by R.\nHaisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff. Newtonian Inertia is due to the strictly\nlocal, electrical force interactions of matter particles (consisting of real\nelectrically charged fermions) with the surrounding, electrically charged,\nvirtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum. The force originates from each\ncharged fermion particle of the mass undergoing relative acceleration with the\nthe quantum vacuum particles. The sum of all these tiny electrical forces\noriginating from each electrically charged particle in the mass is the source\nof the total inertial force of a mass, which is the force that opposes\naccelerated motion in Newton's famous inertia law 'F = MA'. Gravity also\ninvolves the same 'inertial' electrical force component that exists for\ninertial mass described above. The Weak Equivalence Principle turns out to be a\nphysical phenomenon, originating from common 'lower level' quantum processes in\nboth gravitational and inertial mass. The magnitude of the gravitational mass\nof a test mass on the earth results from the same quantity of electrical force\ninteractions as in inertia, but on the earth it is the virtual fermions of the\nquantum vacuum that are actually accelerating downward (on a statistical\naverage basis) with respect to the test mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 1999 16:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
