However, the elegant\nidea of parallax measurement, which was proposed to resolve the lens parameter\ndegeneracy, paradoxically suffers from its own degeneracy due to the ambiguity\nof the source star trajectory.

I consider rotating black holes, in particular the extremal ones.\nFor such black holes the ``no naked singularity condition'' bounds the total\nangular momentum J by A_H/8 pi G, where A_H is the horizon area and G Newton's\nconstant. A similar bound on J comes from the quantum theory. The requirement\nthat these two bounds are the same fixes the value of Immirzi parameter to be\nunity. A byproduct of this argument is the picture of the quantum extremal\nrotating black hole in which all the spin entering the extremal hole is\nconcentrated in a single puncture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 1999 05:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The interaction process is analysed within the generalised 'effective\n(optical) potential method' in which we avoid any usual perturbative reduction.\nIt then appears that for generic system parameters the protofields, instead of\nsimply 'falling' one onto another and forming a fixed 'bound state', are\nengaged in a self-sustained process of nonlinear pulsation, or 'quantum beat',\nconsisting in unceasing cycles of self-amplified auto-squeeze, or 'collapse'\n('reduction'), of a portion of the extended protofields to a small volume\nfollowed by the inverse phase of extension. Centres of consecutive reductions\nform the physical 'points' of thus emerging, intrinsically discrete space, and\neach of them is 'selected' by the system in a causally random fashion among\nmany equally possible versions (or 'realisations'). This is a manifestation of\nthe dynamic redundance forming the unified basis of dynamically complex\n(chaotic) behaviour of any real system with interaction (physics/9806002). The\nsequence of reduction events constitutes the elementary physical 'clock' of the\nworld providing it with the unceasing, intrinsically irreversible time flow.\nThe complex-dynamical quantum beat process in the system of two interacting\nprotofields is observed as the massive elementary particle (like the electron)\nwhich naturally possesses the property of physically real wave-particle duality\ncompleting the double solution concept of Louis de Broglie (see also\nquant-ph/9902016, gr-qc/9906077).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 1999 09:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 18:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This complex dynamical mechanism of universal gravitation provides\ncausal extension of general relativity intrinsically unified with causal\nquantum mechanics and special relativity, as well as physical origin and\nunification of all the four 'fundamental forces' (also gr-qc/9906077). The\ndynamic origin of the Dirac quantization rules is also revealed and used for\nthe first-principles derivation of the Dirac and Schroedinger equations\ndescribing the same irreducibly complex, internally nonlinear interaction\nprocesses within field-particles and their simplest systems (quant-ph/9511034 -\nquant-ph/9511038).
