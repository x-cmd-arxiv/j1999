Experiments are performed on an\nidentified neuron in the visual system of the blowfly. It is shown that the\nspike trains exhibit universal behavior over short time, modulated by a\nstimulus-dependent envelope over long time. A model of the neuron as a\nnonlinear oscillator driven by noise and an external stimulus, is suggested to\naccount for these results. The model enables a theoretic distinction of the\neffects of internal neuronal properties from effects of external stimulus\nproperties, and their identification in the measured spike trains. The\nuniversal regime is characterized by one dimensionless parameter, representing\nthe internal degree of irregularity, which is determined both by the\nsensitivity of the neuron and by the properties of the noise. The envelope is\nrelated in a simple way to properties of the input stimulus as seen through\nnonlinearity of the neural response. Explicit formulas are derived for\ndifferent statistical properties in both the universal and the\nstimulus-dependent regimes. These formulas are in very good agreement with the\ndata in both regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 1999 20:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
