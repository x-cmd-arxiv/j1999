Prior to this burst, it was not known if\nthe shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for the\ngamma rays was still possible. If the gamma-rays are produced in the external\nshock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of the\nshell and increase by about 2.3. We analyze the fine time structure observed in\nthe gamma-ray data from BATSE and determine that the width of the peaks do not\nincrease as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are, at most, a\nfactor of 1.15 longer than the earlier pulses. We also analyze the variability\nto determine what fraction of the shell's surface could be involved in the\nproduction of the gamma rays, the so-called surface filling factor. For\nGRB990123 we find a filling factor of 0.008.

We analyse the dependency of this quantity to the new phase coming from\nthe complex Yukawa couplings in the theory and we find that there exist a\nconsiderable CP violation for the relevant process. Further, we see that the\nsign of the Wilson coefficient C_7^{eff} can be determined by fixing dilepton\nmass. Therefore, the future measurements of CP asymmetry for B --> K^* l^+ l^-\ndecay will give a powerful information about the sign of Wilson coefficient\nC_{7}^{eff} and the new physics beyond the SM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 1999 11:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 1999 06:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

By using dynamical systems techniques, it is shown that the\ndark soliton can persist as either a regular perturbation or a singular\nperturbation of that which exists for the NLS. When considering the stability\nof the soliton, a major difficulty which must be overcome is that eigenvalues\nmay bifurcate out of the continuous spectrum, i.e., an edge bifurcation may\noccur. Since the continuous spectrum for the NLS covers the imaginary axis, and\nsince for the CGL it touches the origin, such a bifurcation may lead to an\nunstable wave. An additional important consideration is that an edge\nbifurcation can happen even if there are no eigenvalues embedded in the\ncontinuous spectrum. Building on and refining ideas first presented in Kapitula\nand Sandstede (Physica D, 1998) and Kapitula (SIAM J. Math. Anal., 1999), we\nshow that when the wave persists as a regular perturbation, at most three\neigenvalues will bifurcate out of the continuous spectrum. Furthermore, we\nprecisely track these bifurcating eigenvalues, and thus are able to give\nconditions for which the perturbed wave will be stable. For the NLS the results\nare an improvement and refinement of previous work, while the results for the\nCGL are new. The techniques presented are very general and are therefore\napplicable to a much larger class of problems than those considered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 1999 20:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The known\nconnection between decoherence of histories and the existence of records is\nextended from the case of pure initial states to mixed states. Records may\nstill exist but are necessarily imperfect. We formulate an\ninformation-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the\nnumber of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is\napproximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the\nenvironment in the coarse-graining process. This idea is verified in a simple\nmodel consisting of a particle coupled to an environment that can store only\none bit of information. We explore the decoherence and information storage in\nthe quantum Brownian motion model. It is shown that the variables that the\nenvironment naturally measures and stores information about are the Fourier\ncomponents of the function $x(t)$ (describing the particle trajectory). The\nrecords storing the information about the Fourier modes are the positions and\nmomenta of the environmental oscillators at the final time. Decoherence is\npossible even if there is only one oscillator in the environment. The\ninformation count of the histories and records in the environment add up\naccording to our conjecture. These results give quantitative content to the\nidea that decoherence is related to ``information lost''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 1999 12:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 1999 15:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 1999 12:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}
