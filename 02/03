The\ntime evolution is NOT differentiable in these systems, so the hamiltonian does\nnot exist. Instead, there is a new operator, the `Principal Operator', (which\nis roughly speaking the logarithm of the hamiltonian) which is finite (cut-off\nindependent). We construct the Principal operator in several examples,\nincluding the Many body Problem of bosons in two dimensions with a short range\nattractive interaction. This allows us to estimate the ground state energy of a\ntwo-dimensional Bose condensate (with an attractive interaction). The ground\nstate energy depends exponentially on the number of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 1999 20:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
