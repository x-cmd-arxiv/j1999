Since removal of this disk requires an\nexchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets, significant\nplanetary migration can ensue. The planet migration phenomenon is examined\nnumerically by evolving the orbits of the giant planets while they are embedded\nin a planetesimal disk having a mass of M_d=10 to 200 Earth-masses. We find\nthat Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune evolve radially outwards as they scatter the\nplanetesimals, while Jupiter's orbit shrinks as it ejects mass. Higher-mass\ndisks result in more rapid and extensive planet migration. If orbit expansion\nand resonance trapping by Neptune is invoked to explain the eccentricities of\nPluto and its cohort of Kuiper Belt Objects at Neptune's 3:2 mean-motion\nresonance, then our simulations suggest that a disk mass of order M_d~50\nEarth-masses is required to expand Neptune's orbit by ~7 AU in order to pump up\nPlutino eccentricities to e~0.3.

The uncertainty\nrelated to the choice of the electromagnetic nucleon form factors is discussed.\nThe effects produced by the meson exchange currents generated by the exchange\nof a single pion are studied, as well as the need of including relativistic\ncorrections to the one-body currents. The results of the continuum shell model\nand those of the Fermi gas model are compared and the need of treating the\nemitted nucleon within a relativistic framework is studied. We analyze the\nresults of Random Phase Approximation calculations not only in terms of their\neffects on the mean field responses, but also in terms of the theoretical\nconsistency in the choice of the effective residual interaction. The role of\nthe final state interaction is investigated. A microscopic justification of the\nuse of complex optical potential to describe the final state interaction is\nprovided. The effects of the final state interaction on the mean field\nresponses are studied with a sum rule conserving model. A comparison with the\nexperimental data measured in the C12 and Ca40 nuclei is shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 1999 20:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

EMQG is based on a new theory of inertia (ref. 5) proposed by R. Haisch, A.\nRueda, and H. Puthoff (which we modified and called Quantum Inertia). Quantum\nInertia states that classical Newtonian Inertia is a property of matter due to\nthe strictly local electrical force interactions of each of the (electrically\ncharged) elementary particles of the mass (masseon particles) with the\nsurrounding (electrically charged) virtual particles (virtual masseons) of the\nquantum vacuum. The sum of all the tiny electrical forces (photon exchanges\nwith the vacuum particles) that originate in each charged elementary particle\nof the accelerated mass is the source of the total inertial force of a mass\nwhich opposes accelerated motion in Newton's law 'F = MA'. We invoked\nEinstein's principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass to\nunderstand the origin of gravitational mass from the perspective of quantum\ninertia. We found that gravity also involves the same 'inertial' electrical\nforce component that exists in inertial mass. We propose that Einstein's\ngeneral relativistic Weak Equivalence Principle originates from common 'lower\nlevel' quantum vacuum processes occurring in both gravitational mass and\ninertial mass in accordance with the principles of quantum field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 1999 16:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
