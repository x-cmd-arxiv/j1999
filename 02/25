Due to the interaction of the magnetic field\nwith remote charged particles, the rotation of the black hole and disk induces\nan electromotive force, which can power an astrophysical load at remote\ndistance. The power of the black hole and disk is calculated.

As an illustrating example of this approach, we investigate how\nliquid rubidium becomes a plasma by increasing the temperature from 0 to 30 eV\nat a fixed normal ion-density $1.03 \\times 10^{22}/cm^3$. The electron-ion\nradial distribution function (RDF) in liquid Rb has distinct inner-core and\nouter-core parts.

The ``predictive\ninformation'' defined in this way has connections to measures of complexity\nthat have been proposed both in the study of dynamical systems and in\nmathematical statistics. In particular, the predictive information diverges\nwhen the observed data stream allows us to learn an increasingly precise model\nfor the dynamics that generate the data, and the structure of this divergence\nmeasures the complexity of the model. We argue that divergent contributions to\nthe predictive information provide the only measure of complexity or richness\nthat is consistent with certain plausible requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 1999 14:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
