This sample comprises 19\nHigh-energy cutoff BL Lacs objects (HBLs), 1 Low-energy cutoff BL Lac object\n(LBL) and 2 `intermediate' sources. Data for LBLs, which are mostly radio\nselected BL Lac objects (RBLs) are taken from the literature. It is shown that\nthe radio--millimetre spectral indices ($\\alpha_{5-230)$) of HBLs\n($-0.29\\pm0.15$) are slightly steeper than those of the LBLs ($-0.19\\pm0.14$).\nA correlation exists between $\\alpha_{5-230}$ and 230 GHz luminosity. While\nthis correlation could be an artefact of comparing two populations of BL Lac\nobjects with intrinsically different radio properties it is also consistent\nwith the predictions of existing unified schemes which relate BL Lac objects to\nFanaroff- Riley class I radio galaxies. The HBLs have significantly flatter\nsubmillimetre- X-ray spectral indices ($\\alpha_{230-X}$) than the LBLs\n($-0.68\\pm0.07$ cf. $-1.08\\pm0.06$)although the two intermediate sources also\nhave intermediate values of $\\alpha_{230-X}\\sim-0.9$. It is argued that this\ndifference cannot be explained entirely by the viewing angle hypothesis and\nrequires a difference in physical source parameters. The $\\alpha_{230-X}$\nvalues for the HBLs are close to the canonical value found for large samples of\nradio sources and thus suggest that synchrotron radiation is the mechanism that\nproduces the X-ray emission. As suggested by Padovani & Giommi, the\ninverse-Compton mechanism is likely to dominate in the LBLs requiring the\nsynchrotron spectra of these sources to steepen or cutoff at lower frequencies\nthan those of the HBLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 1999 16:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Things must be declared\n\"different\" at the electronic level to renounce classical physics. This paper\nshows that classical physics still operates at the electronic level! Electron\nparticles are always there. Mass-to-wave/energy conversion and its reversal\n(duality) on-demand does not actually exist - a ruse that cloaks the\nnegative-negative waive. There is no electron spin-reversal - a gimmick with\n\"nmls\" not even consistent orthogonality. The MCAS Way describes the behavior\nof electrons while preserving their wholeness, mutual orthogonality, and\ninteractive adaptivity.\n  Electrostatics of some simple molecules modeled the MCAS Way are presented.\nThe orbital extent of an electron is shown to be finite while its electrostatic\npresence stretches to infinity. Electrons hardly ever occupy the region on the\naxis between two nuclei of a molecule. Excellent correspondence of NMR proton\nshift with the magnitude of the electrostatic field at the proton is found.\n  Wholly integer quantum numbers identify the orbital spaces of an atom.\nElectrons do not have quantum numbers! The electron of the hydrogen atom is\nassigned the 11111 orbital; those of helium are in the 11111 and 11-111\norbitals; and so on. Unlike the static spdf designation, an electron moves to a\ndifferent type orbital with sufficient electron loading of a shell! A quantum\ntheory does not need duality! The current one, however, needs a different base\nmodel to treat particulates.\n  Bimolecular substitution reactions are shown to be path-dependent with an\nelectron transferred in the Transition State. Traditional microscopic\nreversibility is trashed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 1999 17:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2001 20:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
