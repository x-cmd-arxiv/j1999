Hard X-ray\ncomponent of the spectra is usually explained by Compton upscattering of\noptical/UV photons from optically thick cold plasma by hot electrons.\nObservations also indicate that some of these objects are quite efficient in\nconverting gravitational energy of accretion matter into radiation. Existing\ntheoretical models have difficulties in explaining the two plasma components\nand high intensity of hard X-rays. Most of the models assume that the hot\ncomponent emerges from the cold one due to some kind of instability, but no one\noffers a satisfactory physical explanation for this. Here we propose a solution\nto these difficulties that reverses what was imagined previously: in our model\nthe hot component forms first and afterward it cools down to form the cold\ncomponent. In our model, accretion flow has initially a small angular momentum,\nand thus it has a quasi-spherical geometry at large radii. Close to the black\nhole, the accreting matter is heated up in shocks that form due to the action\nof the centrifugal force. The hot post-shock matter is very efficiently cooled\ndown by Comptonization of low energy photons and condensates into a thin and\ncold accretion disk. The thin disk emits the low energy photons which cool the\nhot component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 1999 17:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The most favoured\nmodel, at least for low and intermediate mass stars, is that the molecules are\naccelerated at jet-driven bow shocks. Here we investigate, through high\nresolution numerical simulations, the efficiency of this mechanism in\naccelerating ambient molecular gas without causing dissociation. The efficiency\nof the mechanism is found to be surprisingly low suggesting that more momentum\nmay be present in the underlying jet than previously thought. We also compare\nthe momentum transferring efficiencies of pulsed versus steady jets. We find\nthat pulsed jets, and the corresponding steady jet with the same average\nvelocity, transfer virtually the same momentum to the ambient gas. The\nadditional momentum ejected sideways from the jet beam in the case of the\npulsed jet only serves to accelerate post-shock jet gas which forms a, largely\natomic, sheath around the jet beam.\n  For both the steady and pulsing jets, we find a power law relationship\nbetween mass and velocity ($m(v) \\propto v^{-\\gamma}$) which is similar to what\nis observed.

However there are three major factors to\ntake into account while comparing clustering measurements coming from various\nsurveys: the so-called ``scale-dependence'' effect, due to measurements being\nmade at different scales; the ``type-selection'' effect introduced by the fact\nthat different galaxy surveys select different populations which do not have\nthe same clustering amplitudes; and the Malmquist bias.

The usual formalism for\nthe renormalization group in field theory or statistical mechanics is reviewed,\ntogether with its limits. The constructive formalism is introduced step by\nstep. Taylor forest formulas allow to perform easily the cluster and Mayer\nexpansions which are needed for a single step of the renormalization group in\nthe case of Bosonic theories. The iteration of this single step leads to\nfurther difficulties whose solution is briefly sketched. The second part of the\ncourse is devoted to Fermionic models.

It is shown how the Taylor forest formulas allow to reorganize\nperturbation theory nicely in order to construct the Gross-Neveu2 model without\nany need for cluster or Mayer expansions.

Cold atoms are localized in the vicinity of points where\ndark states are not destroyed by a magnetic field. As a result the optical\ninteraction tends to zero (dark or gray lattices). Depending on the field\nconfiguration such a lattice can exhibit one or two-dimensional periodicity. It\nis shown that in 1D and 2D dark magneto-optical lattices the effects connected\nwith the Bose-statistics of particles can be observed under the temperature\n$10^{-5}-10^{-6}K$ and densities $10^{11}-10^{12} cm^{-3}$, those are usual for\ncurrent experiments on laser cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 1999 03:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 1999 15:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 1999 05:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In the limit of large $N$ the problem\nsimplifies. In particular the only relevant measure of the quality of the\nestimation is the mean quadratic error matrix. Here we present a bound on the\nmean quadratic error which is a new quantum version of the Cram\\'er-Rao\ninequality. This new bound expresses in a succinct way how in the quantum case\none can trade information about one parameter for information about another\nparameter. The bound holds for arbitrary measurements on pure states, but only\nfor separable measurements on mixed states--a striking example of non-locality\nwithout entanglement for mixed but not for pure states. Cram\\'er-Rao bounds are\ngenerally derived under the assumption that the estimator is unbiased. We also\nprove that under additional regularity conditions our bound also holds for\nbiased estimators. Finally we prove that when the unknown states belong to a 2\ndimensional Hilbert space our quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound can always be attained\nand we provide an explicit measurement strategy that attains our bound. This\ntherefore provides a complete solution to the problem of estimating as\nefficiently as possible the unknown state of a large ensemble of qubits in the\nsame pure state. For qubits in the same mixed state, this also provides an\noptimal estimation strategy if one only considers separable measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 1999 14:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 1999 08:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
