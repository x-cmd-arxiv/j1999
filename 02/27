Our\napproach---statistical dynamics---combines methods from both statistical\nmechanics and dynamical systems theory in a way that offers an alternative to\ncurrent ``landscape'' models of evolutionary optimization. We describe the\npopulation dynamics on the macroscopic level of fitness classes or phenotype\nsubbasins, while averaging out the genotypic variation that is consistent with\na macroscopic state. Metastability in epochal evolution occurs solely at the\nmacroscopic level of the fitness distribution. While a balance between\nselection and mutation maintains a quasistationary distribution of fitness,\nindividuals diffuse randomly through selectively neutral subbasins in genotype\nspace. Sudden innovations occur when, through this diffusion, a genotypic\nportal is discovered that connects to a new subbasin of higher fitness\ngenotypes. In this way, we identify innovations with the unfolding and\nstabilization of a new dimension in the macroscopic state space. The\narchitectural view of subbasins and portals in genotype space clarifies how\nfrozen accidents and the resulting phenotypic constraints guide the evolution\nto higher complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 1999 21:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We consider two problems. Firstly we find the most\ngeneral way of manipulating the state to obtain maximally entangled states.\nAfter such a manipulation the entangled state |11>+|22>+....|mm> is obtained\nwith probability p_m. We obtain an expression for the optimal average\nentanglement. Also, some results of Lo and Popescu pertaining to this problem\nare given simple geometric proofs. Secondly, we consider how to manipulate one\ntwo particle entangled pure state to another with certainty. We derive\nNielsen's theorem (which states the necessary and sufficient condition for this\nto be possible) using the method of areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 1999 04:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 1999 02:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
