In this mood, the current evidence concerning the age of the bulk\nstellar populations of early-type galaxies is then reviewed, both for low- as\nwell as high-redshift galaxies, and both for cluster as well as field\nellipticals. All reported evidence argues for the bulk of stars in galactic\nspheroids having formed at high redshift, with only minor late additions and\nsmall dependence on environment. In the final, more speculative Section an\nattempt is made to evaluate how current formation scenarios can account for\nthis observational evidence. The role of spheroids in the cosmic star formation\nand metal enrichment history is also briefly discussed.

(1994) in a joint analysis of Ginga LAC and\nEinstein SSS spectra. Simultaneous analysis of spectra from all ASCA\ninstruments (SIS + GIS) shows that the iron abundance is 0.36 +- 0.03 solar\n3-12' from the center of the cluster and rises ~50% to 0.53 +- 0.04 solar\nwithin the central 2'. The F-test shows that this abundance gradient is\nsignificant at the >99.99% level. Nickel and sulfur abundances are also\ncentrally enhanced. We use a variety of elemental abundance ratios to assess\nthe relative contribution of SN Ia and SN II to the metal enrichment of the\nintracluster gas. We find spatial gradients in several abundance ratios,\nindicating that the fraction of iron from SN Ia increases toward the cluster\ncenter, with SN Ia accounting for ~50% of the iron mass 3-12' from the center\nand ~70% within 2'. The increased proportion of SN Ia ejecta at the center is\nsuch that the central iron abundance enhancement can be attributed wholly to SN\nIa; we find no significant gradient in SN II ejecta. These spatial gradients in\nthe proportion of SN Ia/II ejecta imply that the dominant metal enrichment\nmechanism near the center is different than in the outer parts of the cluster.\nWe show that the central abundance enhancement is unlikely to be due to ram\npressure stripping of gas from cluster galaxies, or to secularly accumulated\nstellar mass loss within the central cD. We suggest that the additional SN Ia\nejecta near the center is the vestige of a secondary SN Ia-driven wind from the\ncD (following a more energetic protogalactic SN II-driven wind phase), which\nwas partially smothered in the cD due to its location at the cluster center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 1999 00:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2000 19:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
