We present in detail the framework to analyze these coherent\nstructures. Our counting arguments for the multiplicities of these structures\nshow that independently of the coefficients of the CGL, there exists a\nsymmetric stationary source solution, which sends out waves with a unique\nfrequency and wave number. Sinks, on the other hand, occur in two-parameter\nfamilies, and play an essentially passive role. Simulations show that sources\ncan send out stable waves, convectively unstable waves, or absolutely unstable\nwaves. We show that there exists an additional dynamical regime where both\nsingle- and bimodal states are unstable; the ensuing chaotic states have no\ncounterpart in single amplitude equations. A third dynamical mechanism is\nassociated with the fact that the width of the sources does not show simple\nscaling with the growth rate epsilon. In particular, when the group velocity\nterm dominates over the linear growth term, no stationary source can exist, but\nsources displaying nontrivial dynamics can survive here.
