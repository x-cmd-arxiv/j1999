The\ndispersion in the MF slopes remains also after removing the mass segregation\neffects by using multimass King-Michie models. The globular cluster MF slopes\nare also flatter than the MF slope of the field stars and of the Galactic\nclusters in the same mass interval. We interpret the MF slope dispersion and\nthe MF flatness as an evidence of dynamical evolution which makes the present\nday globular cluster stellar MFs different from the intial MFs.

Both the HST and\nKeck images show that the optical transient (OT) is clearly offset by 0.6\narcsec from an extended object, presumably the host galaxy. This galaxy is the\nmost likely source of the metallic-line absorption at z = 1.6004 seen in the\nspectrum of the OT. With magnitudes V_{C} ~ 24.6 +/- 0.2 and K = 21.65 +/- 0.30\nmag this corresponds to an L ~ 0.7 L_* galaxy, assuming that it is located at z\n= 1.6. The estimated unobscured star formation rate is SFR ~ 6 M_sun/yr, which\nis not unusually high for normal galaxies at comparable redshifts. The strength\nof the observed metallic absorption lines is suggestive of a relatively high\nmetallicity of the gas, and thus of a chemically evolved system which may be\nassociated with a massive galaxy. It is also indicative of a high column\ndensity of the gas, typical of damped Ly-alpha systems at high redshifts. We\nconclude that this is the host galaxy of GRB 990123.

This class contains the conventional Landau\nFermi-liquid and also the non-Landau Luttinger Fermi-liquid. Another important\nclass of gapless systems is characterized by the topologically stable point\nnodes (Fermi points). Superfluid 3He-A and electroweak vacuum belong to this\nuniversality class. The fermionic quasiparticles (particles) in this class are\nchiral: close to the Fermi points they are left-handed or right-handed massless\nrelativistic particles. Since the spectrum becomes relativistic at low energy,\nthe symmetry of the system is enhanced in the low-energy edge. The low-energy\ndynamics acquires local invariance, Lorentz invariance and general covariance,\nwhich become better and better when the energy decreases. Interaction of the\nfermions near the Fermi point leads to collective bosonic modes, which look\nlike effective gauge and gravitational fields. Since the vacuum of superfluid\n3He-A and electroweak vacuum are topologically similar, we can use 3He-A for\nsimulation of many phenomena in high energy physics, including axial anomaly.\n3He-A textures induce a nontrivial effective metrics of the space, where the\nfree quasiparticles move along geodesics. Possible simulation in 3He-A of event\nhorizon, Hawking radiation, rotating vacuum and conical space are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 1999 16:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 1999 08:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 1999 15:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
