(1997), using perturbation theory, showed that the skewness\nof the large-scale lensing-convergence, or projected mass density, could be\nused to constrain $\\Omega_m$, the matter content of the universe. On the other\nhand, deep weak-lensing field surveys in the near future will likely measure\nthe convergence on small angular scales (< 10 arcmin.), where the signal will\nbe dominated by highly nonlinear fluctuations. We develop a method to compute\nthe small-scale convergence skewness, using a prescription for the highly\nnonlinear three-point function developed by Scoccimarro and Frieman (1998).\nThis method gives predictions that agree well with existing results from\nray-tracing N-body simulations, but is significantly faster, allowing the\nexploration of a large number of models. We demonstrate that the small-scale\nconvergence skewness is insensitive to the shape and normalization of the\nprimordial (CDM-type) power spectrum, making it dependent almost entirely on\nthe cosmological energy contents, through their influence on the global\ngeometrical distances and fluctuation growth rate. Moreover, nonlinear\nclustering appears to enhance the differences between predictions of the\nconvergence skewness for a range of models. Hence, in addition to constraining\n$\\Omega_m$, the small-scale convergence skewness from future deep several-\ndegree-wide surveys can be used to differentiate between curvature dominated\nand cosmological constant ($\\Lambda$) dominated models, as well as to constrain\nthe equation of state of a quintessence component, thereby distinguishing\n$\\Lambda$ from quintessence as well. Finally, our method can be easily\ngeneralized to other measures such as aperture mass statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 1999 20:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Recently, the initial conditions of the pre-big bang\nscenario have been criticized as they introduce large dimensionless parameters\nallowing the Universe to be \"exponentially large from the very beginning\". We\nagree that a set of initial parameters (such as the initial homogeneity scale,\nthe initial entropy) larger than those determined by the initial horizon scale,\nH^{-1}, would be somewhat unnatural to start with. However, in the pre-big bang\nscenario, the initial parameters are all bounded by the size of the initial\nhorizon. The basic question thus becomes: is a maximal homogeneity scale of\norder H^{-1} necessarily unnatural if the initial curvature is small and,\nconsequently, H^{-1} is very large in Planck (or string) units? In the\nimpossibility of experimental information one could exclude \"a priori\", for\nlarge horizons, the maximal homogeneity scale H^{-1} as a natural initial\ncondition. In the pre-big bang scenario, however, pre-Planckian initial\nconditions are not necessarily washed out by inflation and are accessible (in\nprinciple) to observational tests, so that their naturalness could be also\nanalyzed with a Bayesan approach, in terms of \"a posteriori\" probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 1999 18:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 1999 14:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 1999 14:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 1999 18:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We then show that the PTC implies that the fundamental\ngroup of scri maps, via inclusion, onto the fundamental group of D, i.e., every\nloop in D is homotopic to a loop in scri.

The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one\nbut it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and\npotentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure\nstate of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a\n(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle\n(analogue of the) Schr\\\"odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the\ndensity operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The\nmentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this\nwork.\n  This is the fifth closing part of our investigation. We briefly discuss the\nobserver's role in the theory and different realizations of the space-time\nmodel used as a base space in the bundle approach to quantum mechanics. We\npoint the exact conditions for the equivalence of Hilbert bundle and Hilbert\nspace formulations of the theory.
