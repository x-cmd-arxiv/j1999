The\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation is obtained as the saddle-point, and the effects of\nfluctuations and correlations are included by a loop-wise expansion around this\nsaddle point. We show that the Poisson equation is obeyed at each order in the\nloop expansion and explicitly give the expansion of the Gibbs potential up to\ntwo loops. We then apply our formalism to the case of an impenetrable, charged\nwall, and obtain the fluctuation corrections to the electrostatic potential and\ncounter-ion density to one-loop order without further approximations. The\nrelative importance of fluctuation corrections is controlled by a single\nparameter, which is proportional to the cube of the counter-ion valency and to\nthe surface charge density. We also calculate effective interactions between\ncharged particles, which reflect counter-ion correlation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 1999 13:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Discrete slow space variables are introduced in a general\nsetting and the related finite differences are constructed. The method is\napplied to a series of representative examples: the Toda lattice, the nonlinear\nKlein-Gordon chain, the Takeno system and a discrete version of the\nBenjamin-Bona-Mahoney equation. Among the resulting limit models we find a\ndiscrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation (with reversed space-time), a 3-wave\nresonant interaction system and a discrete modified Volterra model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 1999 14:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 1999 09:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
