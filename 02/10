In paper 1, we have solved the wind Euler equation, derived its\ntwo eigenvalues, and addressed the solution topology and wind geometry. Here,\nwe focus on mass loss and velocity laws. We find that disk winds, even in\nluminous novalike variables, have low optical depth, even in the strongest\ndriving lines. This suggests that thick-to-thin transitions in these lines\noccur. For disks with a realistic radial temperature, the mass loss is\ndominated by gas emanating from the inner decade in r. The total mass loss rate\nassociated with a luminosity 10 Lsun is 10^{-12} Msun/yr, or 10^{-4} of the\nmass accretion rate. This is one order of magnitude below the lower limit\nobtained from P Cygni lines, when the ionizing flux shortwards of the Lyman\nedge is supressed. The difficulties with such small mass loss rates in CVs are\nprincipal, and confirm our previous work.

We give a brief outline of quantum\nlogic, and some of its algebraic properties, such as nondistributivity, whereby\nemphasis is given to concrete experimental setups related to quantum logical\nentities. A probability theory based on quantum logic is fundamentally and\nsometimes even spectacularly different from probabilities based on classical\nBoolean logic. We give a brief outline of its nonclassical aspects; in\nparticular violations of Boole-Bell type consistency constraints on joint\nprobabilities, as well as the Kochen-Specker theorem, demonstrating in a\nconstructive, finite way the scarcity and even nonexistence of two-valued\nstates interpretable as classical truth assignments.

We establish a\nsystematic expansion in the ratio between the environmental correlation time\nand the typical system time scale. The leading order recovers the Markov\ntheory, so here we concentrate on the next-order correction corresponding to\nfirst-order non-Markovian master equations. These perturbative equations\ngreatly simplify the general non-Markovian QSD approach, and allow for\nefficient numerical simulations beyond the Markov approximation. Furthermore,\nwe show that each perturbative scheme for QSD naturally gives rise to a\nperturbative scheme for the master equation which we study in some detail.\nAnalytical and numerical examples are presented, including the quantum Brownian\nmotion model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 1999 12:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}
