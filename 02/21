The helium star, which is formed after the first common envelope\nevolution, evolves to form a C+O WD of $\\sim 0.8-1.1 M_\\odot$ with transferring\na part of the helium envelope onto the secondary main-sequence star. This new\nevolutionary path, together with the optically thick wind from mass-accreting\nwhite dwarf, provides a much wider channel to SNe Ia than previous scenarios. A\npart of the progenitor systems are identified as the luminous supersoft X-ray\nsources or the recurrent novae like U Sco, which are characterized by the\naccretion of helium-rich matter. The white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich,\nhelium-enhanced matter from a lobe-filling, slightly evolved companion at a\ncritical rate and blows excess matter in the wind. The white dwarf grows in\nmass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes as an SN Ia.

Here we propose two new\nevolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to SNe Ia much wider.\n(1) We first show that the WD + RG close binary can form from a wide binary\neven with such a large initial separation as $a_i \\lesssim 40000 R_\\odot$. Such\na binary consists of an AGB star and a low mass main-sequence (MS) star, where\nthe AGB star is undergoing superwind before becoming a WD. If the superwind at\nthe end of AGB evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, the\nwind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentum\neffectively. As a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a close\nbinary. Therefore, the WD + RG binary can form from much wider binaries than\nour earlier estimate. (2) When the RG fills its inner critical Roche lobe, the\nWD undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. Our\nearlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this wind\nonly when the mass ratio of RG/WD is smaller than 1.15. Our new finding is that\nthe WD wind can strip mass from the RG envelope, which could be efficient\nenough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the RG/WD mass ratio exceeds\n1.15.

Their study leads to the new notion of a\nneighborhood operator for filters, which in turn leads to an especially simple\ncharacterization of a topology in terms of convergence criteria. Applications\ninclude the topological and regularity series of a convergence space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 1999 06:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Trap-loss\ncollisions between the two species are comprehensively studied. Different\ninelastic collision channels are identified, and inter-species rate\ncoefficients as well as cross sections are determined. It is found that loss\nrates are independent of the optical excitation of Li, as a consequence of the\nrepulsive Li$^*$-Cs interaction. Li and Cs loss by inelastic inter-species\ncollisions can completely be attributed to processes involving optically\nexcited cesium (fine-structure changing collisions and radiative escape). By\nlowering the trap depth for Li, an additional loss channel of Li is observed\nwhich results from ground-state Li-Cs collisions changing the hyperfine state\nof cesium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 1999 20:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
