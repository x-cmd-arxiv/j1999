The plasma is driven against gravity by a thermal\npressure gradient, as well as by magnetic rotator and radiative forces. At the\nAlfvenic and fast critical points the appropriate criticality conditions are\napplied. The outflow starts almost radially but after the Alfven transition and\nbefore the fast critical surface is encountered the magnetic pinching force\nbends the poloidal streamlines into a cylindrical jet-type shape. The terminal\nspeed, Alfven number, cross-sectional area of the jet, as well as its final\npressure and density obtain uniform values at large distances from the source.\nThe goal of the study is to give an analytical discussion of the\ntwo-dimensional interplay of the thermal pressure gradient, gravitational,\nLorentz and inertial forces in accelerating and collimating an MHD flow.

This paper describes an\ninvestigation of OCR of degraded text images using a standard OCR engine (Adobe\nCapture). The documents were selected from those in the archive at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory. By introducing noise in a controlled manner into perfect\ndocuments, we show how the quality of OCR can be predicted from the nature of\nthe noise. The preliminary results show that a simple noise model can give good\nprediction of the number of OCR errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 1999 20:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
