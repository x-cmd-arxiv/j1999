This implies that substructures within larger\nobjects play an important role (but a mean spherically averaged density profile\nmay exist). In particular, a possible interpretation is that collapsed objects\ncan be divided into an infinite hierarchy of smaller objects with increasingly\nlarge densities (these substructures might also be continuously destroyed and\ncreated by the long-range action of gravity).

Such an instability does not occur in the\ndiffusion limited case. In stable cases the height profile, h(r,t), is flat at\nradii r<R(t)\\sim t^{1/4}. Outside this flat region the height profile obeys the\nscaling scenario \\partial h/\\partial r = {\\cal F}(r t^{-1/4}).

It admits a family of solutions and the mechanism responsible\nfor the selection of a unique scaling function is discussed in detail.

Then, we explain what is the quark-gluon plasma and\nconsider why and when the hadrons can dissolve liberating the quarks and\ngluons. The heavy-ion collisions at high-energies, which provide a unique\nopportunity to get a droplet of the quark-gluon plasma in the terrestrial\nconditions, are described.

It is shown, that the necessary and sufficient condition for there to be\na negligible probability of the trajectory deviating significantly from the\nclassical trajectory at any stage in the motion is, that the state be a\nnarrowly localised wave packet. The properties of the Bohmian trajectories are\ndiscussed in relationship to the theory of retrodictively optimal simultaneous\nmeasurements of position and momentum which was presented in several previous\npapers. It is shown that the Bohmian velocity at x is the expectation value of\nthe velocity which would be observed at x, if one were to make a retrodictively\noptimal simultaneous measurement of x and p, in the limit as the error in the\nmeasurement of x tends to zero. This explains the tendency of the Bohmian\nparticle to behave in a highly non-classical manner. It also explains why the\ntrajectories in the interpretation recently proposed by Garcia de Polavieja\ntend to be much more nearly classical in the limit of large quantum number. The\nimplications for other trajectory interpretations are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 1999 23:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 1999 22:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
