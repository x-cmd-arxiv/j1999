The `shocked' gas is mostly\nconcentrated south-west of the galaxy's center, in coincidence with the\nposition of H-alpha bubbles and with extended soft X-ray emission. The H-alpha\nemission from the shock-excited gas is ~1-2% of the total. About 80-90% of the\nDIG is consistent with being photoionized, requiring that about 10% of the\nionizing photons escape from the starburst site.

The results for NGC5236 are less clear than for NGC5253, as the\nimages are not as deep. The emission line ratio maps show very little or no\nevidence for presence of shock excitation and very little or no ionized gas\nappears expanding from the center of the galaxy outward along the disk plane.\nThe starburst in NGC5236 is thus more strongly confined than that in NGC5253,\nprobably due to the deeper gravitational potential well of the more massive\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 1999 22:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this\npaper, a modification of this theory is presented, where instead of fixing a\nhomotopy type one considers a weaker information. Roughly speaking, one\ncompares n-dimensional compact manifolds with topological spaces whose\nk-skeletons are fixed, where k is at least [n/2]. A particularly attractive\nexample which illustrates the concept is given by complete intersections. By\nthe Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, a complete intersection of complex dimension\nn has the same n-skeleton as CP^n and one can use the modified theory to obtain\ninformation about their diffeomorphism type although the homotopy\nclassification is not known. The theory reduces this classification result to\nthe determination of complete intersections in a certain bordism group. The\nrestrictions are: If d = d_1 ... d_r is the total degree of a complete\nintersection X^n_{d_1,..., d_r} of complex dimension n, then the assumption is,\nthat for all primes p with p(p-1) <= n+1, the total degree d is divisible by\np^{[(2n+1)/(2p-1)]+1}.\n  Theorem A.
