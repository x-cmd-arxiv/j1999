Under the assumption of small magnetic\nfield, an iterative map is developed. We consider both the case in which no\nradiation is assumed and the radiative case, using the Lorentz-Dirac equation\nto describe the motion. Comparison between the non-radiative case and the\nradiative case shows that in both cases one can observe a stochastic web\nstructure for weak magnetic fields, and, although there are global differences\nin the result of the map, that both cases are qualitatively similar in their\nsmall scale behavior. We also develop an iterative map for strong magnetic\nfields. In that case the web structure no longer exists; it is replaced by a\nrich chaotic behavior. It is shown that the particle does not diffuse to\ninfinite energy; it is limited by the boundaries of an attractor (the\nboundaries are generally much smaller than light velocity). Bifurcation occurs,\nconverging rapidly to Feigenbaum's universal constant. The chaotic behavior\nappears to be robust.\n  For intermediate magnetic fields, it is more difficult to observe the web\nstructure, and the influence of the unstable fixed point is weaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 1999 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The effective action\nof the theory is obtained from a non-perturbative sum of scalar curvature terms\nin the propagator. We numerically investigate the semiclassical Einstein\nequations derived from it. As a result of non-perturbative quantum effects, the\nscalar curvature of the matter-dominated universe stops decreasing and\napproaches a constant value. The universe in our model evolves from an open\nmatter-dominated epoch to a mildly inflating de Sitter expansion. The Hubble\nconstant during the present de Sitter epoch, as well as the time at which the\ntransition occurs from matter-dominated to de Sitter expansion, are determined\nby the mass of the field and by the present matter density. The model provides\na theoretical explanation of the observed recent acceleration of the universe,\nand gives a good fit to data from high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, with a mass\nof about 10^{-33} eV, and a current ratio of matter density to critical\ndensity, Omega_0 <0.4 . The age of the universe then follows with no further\nfree parameters in the theory, and turns out to be greater than 13 Gyr. The\nmodel is spatially open and consistent with the possibility of inflation in the\nvery early universe. Furthermore, our model arises from the standard\nrenormalizable theory of a free quantum field in curved spacetime, and does not\nrequire a cosmological constant or the associated fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 1999 20:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 1999 20:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Molecular\nmechanics and peptide and protein crystallographic databases are an essential\npart of this analysis because they independently suggest that the trans\ngauche-plus and gauche-minus trans rotational isomers of the leucine side chain\npredominate.
