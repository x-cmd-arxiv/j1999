Outside the cooling flow\nregion, the beta-model describes the observed surface brightness closely, but\nnot precisely. Between 0.3 and 1 virial radii, the profiles are characterized\nby a power law with slope, expressed in terms of the beta parameter, in the\nrange beta=0.65 to 0.85. The values of beta in this range of radii are\ntypically larger by ~0.05 than those derived from the global fit. There is a\nmild trend for the slope to increase with temperature, from <beta>~0.68 for 3\nkeV clusters to ~0.8 for 10 keV clusters; however, even at high temperatures\nthere are clusters with flat gas profiles, 0.7. Our values of beta at large\nradius are systematically higher, and the trend of beta with temperature is\nweaker than was previously found; the most likely explanation is that earlier\nstudies were affected by an incomplete exclusion of the central cooling flow\nregions. For our regular clusters, the gas distribution at large radii is quite\nclose to spherically symmetric and this is shown not to be an artifact of the\nsample selection. The gas density profiles are very similar when compared in\nthe units of cluster virial radius. The radius of fixed mean gas overdensity\n1000 (corresponding to the dark matter overdensity 200 for Omega=0.2) shows a\ntight correlation with temperature, R~T**0.5, as expected from the virial\ntheorem for clusters with the universal gas fraction. At a given temperature,\nthe rms scatter of the gas overdensity radius is only ~7% which translates into\na 20% scatter of the gas mass fraction, including statistical scatter due to\nmeasurement uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 1999 06:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It describes an open quantum system interacting with a\nsingle thermodynamic bath but otherwise not aided from outside. Its activity is\ngiven by the standard linear Liouville equation for the system and bath. Owing\nto its selforganization property, the model then yields cyclic conversion of\nheat from the bath into mechanical work without compensation. Hence, it\nprovides an explicit thought construction of perpetuum mobile of the second\nkind, contradicting thus the Thomson formulation of the second law of\nthermodynamics. No approximation is involved as a special scaling procedure is\nused which makes the kinetic equations employed exact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 1999 09:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2000 11:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
