The obtained total current J_k\ntakes an enhanced value and is no more perpendicular to the Fermi surface due\nto the strong AF fluctuations. By virtue of this mechanism, the anomalous\nbehavior of R_H in high-Tc cuprates is neutrally explained. We find that both\nthe temperature and the (electron, or hole) doping dependences of R_H in\nhigh-T_c cuprates are reproduced well by numerical calculations based on the\nfluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, applied to the single-band Hubbard\nmodel. We also discuss the temperature dependence of R_H in other nearly AF\nmetals, e.g., V_2O_3, kappa-BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and heavy fermion\nsystems close to the AF phase boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 1999 06:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It\nhas been recognized that this temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient is\ndue to highly anisotropic quasiparticle damping rate on the Fermi surface. In\nthis paper we further take account of the vertex correction to the current\nvertex arising from quasiparticle interactions. Then the transport current is\ntransformed to a large extent from the quasiparticle velocity, and is no longer\nproportional to the latter. As a consequence some pieces of the Fermi surface\noutside of the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone make negative contribution to\nthe Hall conductivity, even if the curvature of the Fermi surface is hole-like.\nThe Hall coefficient is much larger at low temperatures than the estimate made\nwithout the vertex correction. Temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic\nspin correlation length is also crucial to cause remarkable temperature\ndependence of the Hall coefficient.
