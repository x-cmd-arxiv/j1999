Using published data we focus on the spectral\nproperties of the eight radio-selected cluster members and show that these\ncomprise a large fraction of the post-starburst population in the cluster. The\nsimplest interpretation of the radio emission from these galaxies is that they\nare currently forming massive stars, contradicting their classification as\npost-starburst systems based on the optical spectra. We suggest that this star\nformation is hidden from view in the optical by the same obscuring dust which\nis apparent in our comparison on the optical and near-infrared morphologies of\nthese galaxies. We caution that even in the restframe optical the effects of\ndust cannot be ignored when comparing samples of distant galaxies to\nlow-redshift systems, particularly if dust is as prevelant in distant galaxies\nas appears to be the case in our study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 1999 07:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

To this purpose, we analyze the\nColor-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) of six very old clusters, namely NGC 188, NGC\n6791, Collinder 261, Melotte 66, Berkeley 39 and Berkeley 17, and determine\ntheir ages. For each cluster we use the most recent photometric and\nspectroscopic data and metallicity estimates. The ages are derived from the\nisochrone fitting method using the stellar models of the Padua library\n(Bertelli et al . 1994, Girardi et al. 1999). We find that the ages of these\nclusters fall in the range 4 to 9-10 Gyr: Melotte 66 is the youngest whereas\nNGC 6791 and Berkeley 17 have ages of about 9-10 Gyr. Previous estimates for\nBerkeley 17 indicated an age as old as 12 Gyr, almost falling within the range\nof classical globular clusters. In our analysis, this cluster is always very\nold but perhaps somewhat younger than in previous studies. However we call\nattention on the fact that the above ages are to be taken as provisional\nestimates, because of the many uncertaintes still affecting stellar models in\nthe mass range 1.0 to 1.5 Mo. Despite this drawback of extant theory of stellar\nstructure, if NGC 6791 and Berkeley 17 set the limit to the age of the Galactic\nDisk, this component of the Milky Way can be as old as 9-10 Gyr, but surely\nyounger than the Galactic Halo, at least as inferred from recent determinations\nof the age of globular clusters. Finally, it is worth recalling that open\nclusters can only provide a lower limit to the age of the Galactic Disk, while\nother indicators - like White Dwarfs - are perhaps more suited to this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 1999 09:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At generic points of\nthe monopole moduli space the SU(N) gauge group is broken down to $U(1)^{N-1}$\nreproducing the key feature of 't Hooft's Abelian projection. There are certain\npoints in the moduli space where monopole positions coincide, gauge symmetry is\nenhanced and gluons emerge as massless excitations. We show that there is a\nlinearly rising potential between zerobranes. This indicates the presence of a\nstretched flux tube between monopoles. The lowest energy state is achieved when\nmonopoles are sitting on top of each other and gauge symmetry is enhanced. In\nthis case they behave as free massive particles and can condense. In fact, we\nfind a constant eigenfunction of the corresponding Hamiltonian which describes\ncondensation of monopoles. Using the monopole quantum mechanics, we argue that\nlarge $N$ QCD in this T-dual picture is a theory of a closed bosonic membrane\npropagating in {\\em five} dimensional space-time.

Consequently, our calculation accounts for\nall the cusps in the wave function whenever an interparticle separation\nvanishes. Unlike a truncated multipole expansion, the calculation presented\nhere is exact. Following the systematic development of the procedure for an\narbitrary number of particles, we demonstrate it explicitly with the simplest\nnontrivial example, the three-body system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 1999 00:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The basic distinction of this theory arises from that the\nquantum theory equations (including well-known Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon and\nquadratic Dirac equations) are obtained from de Broglie postulate geometric\ngeneralization. Rather, they are obtained as the free wave equations on a\nmanifold metrizing force interactions of particles. Such view on the quantum\ntheory basic equations allows one to use semiclassical models for the quantum\nsystem simulation. The quantization principle modifies as well. Namely, quantum\nsystem stationary conditions are such conditions, at which test particles\nmotion is Lyapunov stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 1999 08:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The well-formedness\nconditions for the automata are specified ensuring unitarity of evolution. A\nspecial kind of QF1CA, called simple, that satisfies the well-formedness\nconditions is introduced. That allows to specify rules for constructing such\nautomata more naturally and simpler than in general case. Possible models of\nlanguage recognition by QF1CA are considered.
