We have investigated the stationarity of 21-electrode multivariate\nEEG data recorded from ten patients during generalized tonic-clonic (GTC)\nseizures elicited by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Stationarity was examined\nby calculating probability density functions (pdfs) and power spectra over\nsmall equal-length non-overlapping time windows and then by studying visually\nand quantitatively the evolution of these quantities over the duration of the\nseizures. Our analysis shows that most of the seizures had time intervals of at\nleast a few seconds that were statistically stationary by several criteria and\nsimultaneously for different electrodes, and that some leads were delayed in\nmanifesting the statistical changes associated with seizure onset evident in\nother leads. The stationarity across electrodes was further examined by\nstudying redundancy of the EEG leads and how that redundancy evolved over the\ncourse of the GTC seizures. Using several different measures, we found a\nsubstantial redundancy which suggests that fewer than 21 electrodes will likely\nsuffice for extracting dynamical and clinical insights. The redundancy analysis\nalso demonstrates for the first time posterior-to-anterior time delays in the\nmid-ictal region of GTC seizures, which suggests the existence of propagating\nwaves.

They can be tested rather soon by\nthe upcoming experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL (RHIC).\nHere I focus on the question whether hadronic observables are sensitive to the\nEquation of State (EOS) in the ultradense matter. A new version of RQMD has\nbeen developed recently in which the EOS can be varied, for instance like the\none observed in lattice gauge studies. It is found that -- somewhat\nparadoxically -- the partial transparency of the two nuclei provides new\navenues to assess the influence of baryon number in hot matter. One of the\nsignals which are most sensitive to the dynamics is the directed flow of\nnucleons. As a function of rapidity it changes its direction three times.\nSurprisingly, even one of the most simple observables -- the average transverse\nmomenta or slopes -- displays some significant sensitivity to the EOS in the\nphase transition region between hadronic and quark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 1999 21:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
