We confirm the idea of Meszaros and Rees (1992)\nthat an essential part (about 20%) of the energy that is lost by the wind in\nthe process of its deceleration may be transferred to high-energy electrons and\nthen to high-frequency (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission. We show that in the wind\nframe the spectrum of electrons which are accelerated at the wind front and\nmove ahead of the front is nearly a two-dimensional relativistic Maxwellian\nwith a relativistic temperature $T=6*10^9\\Gamma_T$ K, where\n$\\Gamma_T=200\\Gamma_0$ with the accuracy of ~20%, and $\\Gamma_0$ is the Lorentz\nfactor of the wind, $\\Gamma_0>100$ for winds outflowing from cosmological\ngamma-ray bursters. Our simulations point to an existence of a high-energy tail\nof accelerated electrons with a Lorentz factor of more than $700\\Gamma_0$.\nLarge-amplitude electromagnetic waves are generated by the oscillating currents\nat the wind front. The mean field of these waves ahead of the wind front is an\norder of magnitude less than the magnetic field of the wind. High-energy\nelectrons which are accelerated at the wind front and injected into the region\nahead of the front generate synchro-Compton radiation in the fields of\nlarge-amplitude electromagnetic waves. This radiation closely resembles\nsynchrotron radiation and can reproduce the non-thermal radiation of gamma-ray\nbursts observed in the Ginga and BATSE ranges (from a few keV to a few MeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 1999 14:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this paper, we\nre-analyzed the same data set and new observations with the latest calibration\nfiles.

The radial\nprofiles of O, Ne, and Fe show clear jump structures at a radius of 0.9 Rs,\nwhere Rs is the shock radius. Outside of 0.9 Rs, abundances of all elements are\nconstant. On the contrary, inside of 0.9 Rs, abundances of these elements are\n20--30 % larger than those obtained outside of 0.9 Rs. The radial profile of\nkTe also shows the jump structure at 0.9 Rs. This means that the hot and metal\nrich plasma fills the volume inside of 0.9 Rs. We concluded that this jump\nstructure was the possible evidence for the pre-existing cavity produced by the\nprecursor. If the ejecta fills inside of 0.9 Rs, the total mass of the ejecta\nwas roughly 4\\Msun. We then estimated the main-sequence mass to be roughly\n15\\Msun, which supports the massive star in origin of the Cygnus Loop supernova\nremnant and the existence of a pre-existing cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 1999 15:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
