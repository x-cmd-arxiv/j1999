However, to avoid argument concerning\npossible variability in the background pattern, we performed a clincher test\nwhich demonstrates that a cluster's EUV profile is invariant with respect to\nphoton background. The test involves re-observation of A2199 and A1795 when the\nphoton background was respectively three and two times higher than before, and\nusing a different part of the detector. The radial profiles of both clusters,\nwhich have entirely different shapes, were accurately reproduced.

Fitting\nseveral observed light curves simultaneously provides strong constraints on\nmodel parameters such as the run of density and column density across the\nnucleus, the shape of the ionizing continuum, and the radial distribution of\nthe emission line clouds. When applying the model to the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC\n5548, we were able to reconstruct the light curves of four ultraviolet\nemission-lines, in time and in absolute flux.

Phys. Fr. I, 4, 1383 (1994)]. According\nto this model, one can distinguish between a static phase and a rolling phase\nthat are able to exchange grains through an erosion/accretion mechanism.\nBoutreux et al. [Phys. Rev. E, 58, 4692 (1998)] proposed a modification of the\nexchange term in order to describe thicker flows where saturation effects are\npresent. However, these approaches assumed that the downhill convection\nvelocity of the grains is constant inside the rolling phase, a hypothesis that\nis not verified experimentally. In this article, we therefore modify the above\nmodels by introducing a velocity profile in the flow, and study the physical\nconsequences of this modification in the simple situation of an avalanche in an\nopen cell. We present a complete analytical description of the avalanche in the\ncase of a linear velocity profile, and generalize the results for a power-law\ndependency. We show, in particular, that the amplitude of the avalanche is\nstrongly affected by the velocity profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 1999 13:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
