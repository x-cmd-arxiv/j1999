We\nhave also discovered evidence of resonantly scattered photons in the red wing\nof the C IV broad emission lines of a few objects. In most cases, the broad\nemission lines have lower polarization and a different position angle than the\ncontinuum.

Although expected at some level, the\nscope of the involvement has significant observational consequences. First, LMC\ndisk orbits are torqued out of the disk plane, thickening the disk and\npopulating a spheroid. The torque results from direct forcing by the Milky Way\ntide and, indirectly, from the drag between the LMC disk and its halo resulting\nfrom the induced precession of the LMC disk. The latter is a newly reported\nmechanism that can affect all satellite interations. However, the overall\ntorque can not isotropize the stellar orbits and their kinematics remains\ndisk-like. Such a kinematic signature is observed for nearly all LMC\npopulations. The extended disk distribution is predicted to increase the\nmicrolensing toward the LMC. Second, the disk's binding energy slowly decreases\nduring this process, puffing up and priming the outer regions for subsequent\ntidal stripping. Because the tidally stripped debris will be spatially\nextended, the distribution of stripped stars is much more extended than the HI\nMagellanic Stream. This is consistent with upper limits to stellar densities in\nthe gas stream and suggests a different strategy for detecting the stripped\nstars. And, finally, the mass loss over several LMC orbits is predicted by\nn-body simulation and the debris extends to tens of kiloparsecs from the tidal\nboundary. Although the overall space density of the stripped stars is low,\npossible existence of such intervening populations have been recently reported\nand may be detectable using 2MASS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 1999 02:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

By\ncomparing the properties of a family of coarse-grained descriptions of the\nchain, we conclude that local coarse-grainings in this family are more useful\nfor prediction than nonlocal ones. A quantum mechanical system exhibits\nclassical behavior when the probability is high for histories having the\ncorrelations in time implied by classical deterministic laws. But approximate\nclassical determinism holds only for certain coarse-grainings and then only if\nthe initial state of the system is suitably restricted. Coarse-grainings by the\nvalues of the hydrodynamic variables (integrals over suitable volumes of\ndensities of approximately conserved quantities) define the histories usually\nused in classical physics. But what distinguishes this coarse-graining from\nothers? This paper approaches this question by analyzing a family of\ncoarse-grainings for the linear harmonic chain. At one extreme in the family\nthe chain is divided into local groups of $N$ atoms. At the other extreme the\n$N$ atoms are distributed nonlocally over the whole chain. Each coarse-graining\nfollows the average (center of mass) positions of the groups and ignores the\n``internal'' coordinates within each group, these constituting a different\nenvironment for each coarse-graining.
