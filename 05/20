An isothermal sphere lens model,\nrequires a velocity dispersion of 1286+72-91 km/s.

The key to the algorithm is decoupling the effects of lens\nmagnification and intrinsic structure in the background source in the\nappearance of lensed arcs. First, the distribution of mass on the deflector\nplane and the geometry of the source-deflector-observer optical system are\nestablished. This is done by numerically simulating the lensing of light past a\nparametric mass model, and adjusting the handful of model parameters to match\nthe positions and shapes of the observed and simulated lensed arcs. At the same\ntime, this determines the magnification of the background source induced by the\nlensing process. The predicted magnification is then removed from the data to\nreveal the intrinsic, though still distorted, background distribution of light.\nAfter tracing each lensed ray back to the source plane, the data are combined\nto produce a surface brightness distribution of the source. This two-stage\ninversion scheme produces a parametric model of the deflector and a pixelized\nrendering of the background source which together mimic the observed\ngravitationally lensed features. We test the viability of scheme itself on a\nwell-studied collection of lensed objects in the galaxy-cluster MS 2137.\nConfident in the algorithm, we apply it second time to predict the distribution\nof mass in the galaxy-cluster MS 1455 responsible for an observed triplet of\nlensed arcs. Our predictions about the lens in MS 1455 make it particularly\ninteresting, for a single background source is responsible for both tangential\narcs and a radial arc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 1999 19:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nperformed a VLA imaging survey of 21 cm absorption in Seyfert and starburst\nnuclei to study the neutral gas in the near-nuclear environment. With the\nexception of NGC 4151, the absorbing gas traces 100 pc scale, rotating disks\naligned with the outer galaxy disk. These disks appear to be rich in atomic gas\nrelative to nuclear disks in non-active spirals. We find no strong evidence for\nrapid in-fall or out-flow of neutral hydrogen, but our limits on the mass\ninfall rates are compatible with that required to feed a Seyfert nucleus.\n  Among the galaxies surveyed here, neutral hydrogen absorption traces\nparsec-scale gas only in NGC 4151. Based on the kinematics of the absorption\nline, the disk symmetry axis appears to align with the radio jet axis rather\nthan the outer galaxy axis. The most surprising result is that we detect no 21\ncm absorption towards the central radio sources of the hidden Seyfert 1 nuclei\nMrk 3, Mrk 348, and NGC 1068. Moreover, 21 cm absorption is commonly observed\ntowards extended radio jet structure but appears to avoid central, compact\nradio sources in Seyfert nuclei. To explain these results, we propose that 21\ncm absorption towards the nucleus is suppressed by either free-free absorption,\nexcitation effects (i.e., enhanced spin temperature), or rapid motion in the\nobscuring gas. Ironically, the implications of these effects is that the\nobscuring disks must be small, typically not larger than a few tens of parsecs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 1999 15:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

If this information is fed back into the systems by coherent\noperations, the single-system density matrix can be made to undergo an\narbitrary nonlinear dynamics, including for example a dynamics governed by a\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We investigate the implications of such\nnonlinear quantum dynamics for various problems in quantum control and quantum\ninformation theory, including quantum computation.
