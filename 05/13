In\nmetal-deficient stars Rb is systematically overabundant relative to Fe; we find\nan average [Rb/Fe] of +0.21 for the 32 stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 and measured\nRb. This behavior contrasts with that of Y, Zr, and Ba, which, with the\nexception of three new CH stars (HD 23439A and B and BD +5 3640), are\nconsistently slightly deficient relative to Fe in the same stars; excluding the\nthree CH stars, we find the stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 have average [Y/Fe],\n[Zr/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] of --0.19 (24 stars), --0.12 (28 stars), and --0.06 (29\nstars), respectively. The different behavior of Rb on the one hand and Y, Zr,\nand Ba on the other can be attributed in part to the fact that in the Sun and\nin these stars Rb has a large r-process component while Y, Zr, and Ba are\nmostly s-process elements with only small r-process components.
