We also report the optical light curve for the star in the\ninterval 1987-1998, including multi-color photometry obtained during 1989-1998.\n  Analysis of the UV emission line spectra indicates most lines decay during\nthe deep declines on characteristic timescales comparable to that reported for\noptical features. Fe, Mg and neutral C lines decay on timescales of typically\n50-100 d. Other lines, notably ionized C lines, decay on longer timescales (>\n200 d) or appear to be unaffected by the declines. The general nature of the UV\nemission lines and other UV features during the declines is consistent with the\nE1/E2/BL line-region model developed from the behavior of optical spectral\nfeatures during declines. However, the detailed line-behavior indicates large\nintrinsic variability between decline events inconsistent with the simple\nE1/E2/BL model. Limited temporal coverage prevents detailed examination of the\ngeometry of the emission line region or the obscuring dust.
