This\nobservation led to the recent proposal that there might exist two further\nten-dimensional theories, namely type IIA^* and type IIB^*, related to type IIB\nand type IIA respectively by a timelike dimensional reduction. In this paper we\nexplore such dimensional reductions in cases where time is the coordinate of a\nnon-trivial U(1) fibre bundle. We focus in particular on situations where there\nis an odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS_{2n+1}, which can be\ndescribed as a U(1) bundle over \\widetilde{CP}^n, a non-compact version of CP^n\ncorresponding to the coset manifold SU(n,1)/U(n).
