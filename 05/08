However this technique requires high precision\nmeasurements of the lensing shear and cautious corrections for systematic\neffects. Kaiser, Squires, & Broadhurst (1995) proposed a method to calibrate\nthe ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of Point Spread Function (PSF)\nanisotropies and camera distortions. We revisit the KSB method and show that\nboth the PSF and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source\nmoments, as opposed to ellipticities. We clarify the applicability of some of\nthe approximations made in this method. We derive expressions for the\ncorrections which only involve the galaxy moments. We derive an explicit\nrelation between the shear and the average ellipticity. We discuss the\nshortcomings of the method, and test its validity using numerical simulations.\nAs an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the HST WFPC2 camera\nperformed by Hoekstra et al. (1998). We confirm the presence of sizable (10%)\nPSF ellipticities at the edge of the WFPC2 chips. We also show that the PSF\nellipticity varies by as much as 2% over time. We use these measurements to\ncorrect the shape of galaxies in the HST Survey Strip (``Groth'' Strip). By\nconsidering the dependence of the ellipticities on object size, we show that,\nafter corrections, the residual systematic uncertainty for galaxies with radii\ngreater than 0.15 arcsec, is about 0.4%, when averaged over each chip.

This\npaper reports on the experimental realization of GHZ correlations using nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR experiment differs from the originally\nproposed GHZ experiment in several ways: it is performed on mixed states rather\nthan pure states; and instead of being widely separated, the spins on which it\nis performed are all located in the same molecule. As a result, the NMR version\nof the GHZ experiment cannot entirely rule out classical local hidden\nvariables. It nonetheless provides an unambiguous demonstration of the\n\"paradoxical\" GHZ correlations, and shows that any classical hidden variables\nmust communicate by non-standard and previously undetected forces. The NMR\ndemonstration of GHZ correlations shows the power of NMR quantum information\nprocessing techniques for demonstrating fundamental effects in quantum\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 1999 21:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
