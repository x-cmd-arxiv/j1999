The high X-ray luminosity of the\nsystem suggests that massive clusters may begin to form at redshifts\nconsiderably greater than unity.

X-ray\nemission from ClJ0152.7-1357 was detected already in 1980 with the EINSTEIN\nIPC. However, because the complex morphology of the emission caused its\nsignificance to be underestimated, the corresponding source was not included in\nthe EMSS cluster sample and hence not previously identified. Simulations of the\nEMSS source detection and selection procedure suggest a general bias of the\nEMSS against X-ray luminous clusters with pronounced substructure.

CYCs are very young (< 5\nMyr), compact (< 1 pc), and only a few tens of pc away from the GC, while they\nappear to be as massive as the smallest Galactic globular clusters (~10^4\nMsun). A survey of cluster lifetimes for various initial mass functions,\ncluster masses, and galactocentric radii is presented. Short relaxation times\ndue to the compactness of CYCs, and the strong tidal fields near the GC make\nclusters evaporate fairly quickly. Depending on cluster parameters, mass\nsegregation may occur on a time scale shorter than the lifetimes of most\nmassive stars, which accelerates the cluster's dynamical evolution even more.\nWhen the difference between the upper and lower mass boundaries of the initial\nmass function is large enough, strongly selective ejection of lighter stars\nmakes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster, so the\ndynamical evolution of those clusters is weakly dependent on the lower mass\nboundary.

Because phase separation can potentially increase the calculated\nages of the oldest white dwarfs, it can affect the age of the Galactic disk as\nderived from the downturn in the white dwarf luminosity function. We find that\nthe largest possible increase in ages due to phase separation is 1.5 Gyr, with\na most likely value of approximately 0.6 Gyr, depending on the parameters of\nour white dwarf models.\n  The most important factors influencing the size of this delay are the total\nstellar mass, the initial composition profile, and the phase diagram assumed\nfor crystallization. We find a maximum age delay in models with masses of 0.6\nsolar masses, which is near the peak in the observed white dwarf mass\ndistribution. We find that varying the opacities (via the metallicity) has\nlittle effect on the calculated age delays.\n  In the context of Galactic evolution, age estimates for the oldest Galactic\nglobular clusters range from 11.5 to 16 Gyr, and depend on a variety of\nparameters. In addition, a 4 to 6 Gyr delay is expected between the formation\nof the globular clusters and that of the Galactic thin disk, while the observed\nwhite dwarf luminosity function gives an age estimate for the thin disk of 9.5\n+/-1.0 Gyr, without including the effect of phase separation. Using the above\nnumbers, we see that phase separation could add between 0 to 3 Gyr to the white\ndwarf ages and still be consistent with the overall picture of Galaxy\nformation. Our calculated maximum value of 1.5 Gyr fits within these bounds, as\ndoes our best guess value of 0.6 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 1999 12:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The special solutions consist of a combination\nof purely solitonic terms propagating along the principal birefringence axes\nand soliton-soliton interaction terms. The solitonic part of the solutions\nindicates that the decay of initially localized pulses could be due to\ndifferent propagation velocities along the birefringence axes. We show that the\ndisintegration of solitonic pulses in birefringent optical fibers can be caused\nby two effects. The first effect is similar as in linear birefringence and is\nrelated to the unequal propagation velocities of the modes along the\nbirefringence axes.
