We compute approximate solutions of the transport\nof cosmic particles at shock fronts with a SDE numerical scheme. The momentum\ngain is given by implicit calculations of the fluid velocity gradients using a\nlinear interpolation between two consecutive time steps. We validate our\nprocedure in the case of single shock acceleration with different shock\nthickness, with or without synchrotron losses. A comparative discussion of\nimplicit and explicit schemes for different shock thickness shows that implicit\ncalculations extend the range of applicability of SDE schemes to infinitely\nthin 1D shocks. The method is then applied to multiple shock acceleration for a\nsystem of identical shocks which free parameters are the distance between two\nconsecutive shocks, the synchrotron losses time and the escape time of the\nparticles. The stationary distribution reproduces quite well the flat\ndifferential logarithm energy distribution produced by multiple shock effect,\nand also the piling-up effect due synchrotron losses at a momentum where they\nequilibrate the acceleration rate. At higher momenta particle losses dominate\nand the spectrum drops. The competition between acceleration and loss effects\nleads to a pile-up shaped distribution which appears to be effective only in a\nrestrict range of inter-shock distances of 10-100 diffusion lengths.

The non-separability manifests itself in the wave function\nof a single particle being influenced by the very presence of other particles.\nIn the simplest case of identical particles, it is the number of particles that\naffects the wave function of each particle and, in particular, the width of its\nGaussian probability density. As a result, this width, a local property, is\ndirectly linked to the mass of the entire Universe in a very Machian manner. In\nthe realistic limit of large $n$ if the width in question is to be microscopic,\nthe coupling constant must be very small resulting in an ``almost linear''\ntheory. This provides a model explanation of why the linearity of quantum\nmechanics can be accepted with such a high degree of certainty even if the more\nfundamental underlying theory could be nonlinear. We also demonstrate that when\nsuch non-correlated solitons are coupled to harmonic oscilators they lead to a\nfaster-than-light nonlocal telegraph since changing the frequency of one\noscillator affects instantaneously the probability density of particles\nassociated with other oscillators. This effect can be alleviated by fine-tuning\nthe parameters of the solution. Exclusion rules of a novel kind that we term\nsupersuperselection rules also emerge from these solutions.
