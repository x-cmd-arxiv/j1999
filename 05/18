The time-averaged X-ray spectrum during spin-down is\nconsiderably harder than during spin-up. The observed torque reversal can be\nexplained by an accretion flow transition triggered by a gradual change in the\nmass accretion rate. The sudden transition to spin-down is caused by a change\nin the accretion flow rotation from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian. 4U 1626-67 is\nestimated to be near spin equilibrium with a mass accretion rate Mdot~2x10**16\ng/s, Mdot decreasing at a rate ~6x10**14 g/s/yr, and a polar surface magnetic\nfield of ~2b_p**{-1/2} 10^**12G where b_p is the magnetic pitch. During\nspin-up, the Keplerian flow remains geometrically thin and cool. During\nspin-down, the sub-Keplerian flow becomes geometrically thick and hot. Soft\nphotons from near the stellar surface are Compton up-scattered by the hot\naccretion flow during spin-down while during spin-up such scattering is\nunlikely due to the small scale-height and low temperature of the flow.

As the carriers of superconductivity, the Cooper pairs, diffuse\nacross the contact into the metal they remain correlated, although the pairing\nmechanism is lifted; we call this the proximity effect. The observation of\nthese superconducting correlations has come within the reach of experiments in\nthe last decade.
