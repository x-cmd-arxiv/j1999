After briefly describing the\nphilosophical principles underlying the theory, we rigorously construct a\ndiscrete model of quantum mechanics. Kets are names, or labels which categorise\nstates of matter but do not directly describe them. The principle of\nsuperposition is seen as a definitional truism in the categorisation of states.\nThis resolves the measurement problem of quantum mechanics by attributing the\ncollapse of the wave function to information. The probability interpretation\nhas a natural meaning in which the configuration of interacting particles plays\nthe role of a hidden variable. The model supports a form of relativistic\nquantum field theory which does not depend on quantisation or second\nquantisation from classical mechanics. Continuous laws of wave mechanics are\nfound in a discrete metaphysic which does not involve waves. Classical law is\nthe expected behaviour of many elementary particles. The constraints on the\ntheory are sufficient to establish that particles are point-like entities with\nspecific properties found in nature. Newton's first law and conservation of\nmomentum are established from the principle of homogeneity. Maxwell's equations\nare derived from the simple interaction in which a Dirac particle emits or\nabsorbs a photon. Feynman rules are calculated for the discrete theory and\ndiffer from the standard rules by the removal of the ultraviolet divergence and\nthe use of proper loop integrals. They give finite and unambiguous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 May 1999 15:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 1999 08:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 1999 14:44:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 1999 07:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 1999 13:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 14:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}
