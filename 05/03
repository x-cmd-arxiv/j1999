The proof\nmake use of a gedanken experiment in which a massive object endowed with a\nscalar charge is lowered adiabatically towards a Schwarzschild's black hole and\nthan dropped into the black hole from some proper distance above the horizon.\nCentral to the proof is the intriguing fact that the self-energy of the\nparticle receives no contribution from the scalar charge.

Universal Lax pair\noperators for all of the generalised Calogero-Moser models and for any choices\nof the potentials are constructed as linear combinations of the reflection\noperators. The consistency conditions are reduced to functional equations for\nthe coefficient functions of the reflection operators in the Lax pair. There\nare only four types of such functional equations corresponding to the\ntwo-dimensional sub-root systems, A_2, B_2, G_2, and I_2(m). The root type and\nthe minimal type Lax pairs, derived in our previous papers, are given as the\nsimplest representations. The spectral parameter dependence plays an important\nrole in the Lax pair operators, which bear a strong resemblance to the Dunkl\noperators, a powerful tool for solving quantum Calogero-Moser models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 1999 12:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
