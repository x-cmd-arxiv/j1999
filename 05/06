The analytical approximations are based on the\nmega-grains model of two-phase clumpy media, as proposed by Hobson & Padman,\ncombined with escape and absorption probability formulae for homogeneous media.\nThe accuracy of the approximations is examined by comparison with 3D Monte\nCarlo simulations of radiative transfer, including multiple scattering. Our\nstudies show that the combined mega-grains and escape/absorption probability\nformulae provide a good approximation of the escaping and absorbed radiation\nfractions for a wide range of parameters characterizing the medium. A realistic\ntest is performed by modeling the absorption of a starlike source of radiation\nby interstellar dust in a clumpy medium, and by calculating the resulting\nequilibrium dust temperatures and infrared emission spectrum of both the clumps\nand the interclump medium. In particular, we find that the temperature of dust\nin clumps is lower than in the interclump medium if clumps are optically thick.\nComparison with Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer in the same\nenvironment shows that the analytic model yields a good approximation of dust\ntemperatures and the emerging UV to FIR spectrum of radiation for all three\ntypes of source distributions mentioned above. Our analytical model provides a\nnumerically expedient way to estimate radiative transfer in a variety of\ninterstellar conditions and can be applied to a wide range of astrophysical\nenvironments, from star forming regions to starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 1999 19:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 1999 23:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We describe how the broad band spectral\nenergy distributions of these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous\nhalos at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by\nlow-radiative efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the\nmass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The\nobserved suppression of the synchrotron component in the radio band and the\nsystematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal\nbremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow\nis a natural consequence of systems accreting at low-radiative efficiencies. We\nbriefly discuss an alternative model for the X-ray emission, namely that it is\ndue to nonthermal synchrotron-self Compton processes in the accretion flow, or\nwind. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a\ncollimated jet viewed off axis should be distinguishable from the\nbremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue\nthat the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and\nelliptical galaxies arises from the different manner in which interstellar gas\nis fed into the nuclei.

In this model, new stars are formed following each supernova\nevent, thus their abundance pattern is determined by the combination of heavy\nelements ejected from the supernova itself and those elements which are already\npresent in the interstellar gas swept up by the supernova remnant. The end\nresult is a prediction of large scatter in the abundance ratios among\nlow-metallicity stars, reflecting a different nucleosynthesis yield for each\nType II supernova with a different progenitor mass. Formation of new stars is\nterminated when supernova remnants sweep up too little gas to form shells. We\nshow from calculations based on the above scenario that (i) the observed [Fe/H]\ndistribution for the Galactic halo field stars can be reproduced without\neffectively decreasing the heavy-element yields from Type II supernovae by some\nmanipulation required by previous models (e.g., via mass loss from the early\nGalaxy, or later mixing with ``pristine'' hydrogen clouds), (ii) the large\nobserved scatter in the abundance ratio [Eu/Fe] for the most metal-poor stars\ncan also be reproduced, and (iii) the frequency distribution of stars in the\n[Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane can be predicted. Our model suggests that the probability\nof identifying essentially metal-free stars (Population III) in the local halo\nis around one in 10^{3-4}, provided that star formation in the halo is confined\nto individual gas clouds with mass of 10^{6-7} Msun and that the initial mass\nfunction of metal-free stars is not significantly different from the Salpeter\nmass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 1999 04:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Another source of inhomogeneous broadening is the\nhydrodynamic coupling of the rotation of the impurity with the center of mass\nvelocity. A quantum hamiltonian to describe this effect is derived from the\nclassical hydrodynamic kinetic energy of an ellipsoid. Simple analytic\nexpressions are derived for the resulting spectral line shape for an impurity\nin bulk He, and the relevant matrix elements derived to allow fully quantum\ncalculations of the coupling of the center of mass motion and rotation for an\nimpurity confined in a spherical He cluster.

The model is\nshown to be compatible with both the CHSH and the CH Bell inequalities.\nMoreover, it bears the same rotational symmetry as spins. The reason why the\nmodel can reproduce the quantum correlation without violating the Bell theorem\nis that in the model the efficiency of the detectors depends on the local\nhidden variable. On average the detector efficiency is limited to 75%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 1999 15:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
