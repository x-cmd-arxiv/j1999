It is well-known that the\nGutenberg-Richter distribution has to be modified for large seismic moments,\ndue to energy conservation and geometrical reasons. Several models have been\nproposed, either in terms of a second power law with a larger b-value beyond a\ncross-over magnitude, or based on a ``hard'' magnitude cut-off or a ``soft''\nmagnitude cut-off using an exponential taper. Since the large scale tectonic\ndeformation is dominated by the very largest earthquakes and since their impact\non loss of life and properties is huge, it is of great importance to constrain\nas much as possible the shape of their distribution. We present a simple and\npowerful probabilistic theoretical approach that shows that the Gamma\ndistribution is the best model, under the two hypothesis that the\nGutenberg-Richter power law distribution holds in absence of any condition\n(condition of criticality) and that one or several constraints are imposed,\neither based on conservation laws or on the nature of the observations\nthemselves. The selection of the Gamma distribution does not depend on the\nspecific nature of the constraint. We illustrate the approach with two\nconstraints, the existence of a finite moment release rate and the observation\nof the size of a maximum earthquake in a finite catalog.

We first show that to a first order approximation, the error rate\nobtained over and above the Bayes error rate, is directly proportional to the\nvariance of the actual decision boundaries around the Bayes optimum boundary.\nCombining classifiers in output space reduces this variance, and hence reduces\nthe \"added\" error. If N unbiased classifiers are combined by simple averaging,\nthe added error rate can be reduced by a factor of N if the individual errors\nin approximating the decision boundaries are uncorrelated.

The particles of the symmetric phase (`phions')\ninteract via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3\nattraction. If the phion mass is sufficiently small, the lowest-energy state is\nnot the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of\nphions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate\ncorresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and\nits excitations (\"phonons\" in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs\nparticles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is\nstill positive; it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes\nnegative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than\nthe Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality;' all\nscattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate\nbecomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum\nlimit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An\nintricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises. We speculate about the\npossible implications of these ideas for gravity and inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 1999 19:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-01"}

Equivalently, in\nsupersymmetric models with explicit lepton-number (R-parity) violation,\nsleptons may also be produced in association with quarks (slepton-strahlung).\nHiggs- and slepton-strahlung production cross sections are given for both the\nTevatron and the LHC. The LHC cross sections imply that heavy ${\\cal{O}}$(TeV)\ncharged Higgs bosons can be produced via charged-Higgs-strahlung and that\nstrahlung production of charged sleptons is possible even for small R-parity\nviolating couplings. The possible discovery of sleptons through this channel\noffers a surprising handle on models of neutrino masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 1999 15:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2000 19:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

Thereby the motion of the\nhidden classical particle is chaotic during almost all nontrivial measurement\nprocesses. For the correct reproduction of experimental results, it is further\nessential that the distribution function $P(x)$ of the results of a position\nmeasurement is identical with $|\\Psi|^2$ of the wavefunction $\\Psi$ of the\nsingle system under consideration. It is shown that this feature is not an\nadditional assumption, but can be derived strictly from the chaotic motion of a\nsingle system during a sequence of measurements, providing a completely\ndeterministic picture of the statistical features of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 1999 13:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
