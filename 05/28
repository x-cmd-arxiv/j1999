The study is carried out both in D=1 and D=2 (square and\nhoneycomb lattices), using exact Lanczos diagonalization, finite-size scaling,\nand Berry's phase calculations of the polarization. The Born effective charge\njump from positive infinity to negative infinity previously discovered in D=1\nby Resta and Sorella is confirmed to be directly connected with the transition\nfrom the band insulator to the Mott insulating state, in agreement with recent\nwork of Ortiz et al.. In addition, symmetry is analysed, and the transition is\nfound to be associated with a reversal of inversion symmetry in the ground\nstate, of magnetic origin. We also study the D=1 excitation spectrum by Lanczos\ndiagonalization and finite-size scaling. Not only the spin gap closes at the\ntransition, consistent with the magnetic nature of the Mott state, but also the\ncharge gap closes, so that the intermediate state between the two insulators\nappears to be metallic. This finding, rationalized within unrestricted\nHartree-Fock as due to a sign change of the effective on-site energy offset\nDelta for the minority spin electrons, underlines the profound difference\nbetween the two insulators. The band-to-Mott insulator transition is also\nstudied and found in the same model in D=2. There too we find an associated,\nalthough weaker, polarization anomaly, with some differences between square and\nhoneycomb lattices.
