Here we review the\nfailures of the commonly-used velocity dispersion models and present an\nempirical method for extracting beta from the quadrupole statistic that has\nlittle systematic offset over a wide range of beta and cosmologies. This\nempirical model is then applied to an ensemble of mock 2dF southern strip\nsurveys, to illustrate the technique and see how accurately we can recover the\ntrue value of beta. We compare this treatment with the error we expect to find\ndue only to the finite volume of the survey. We find that non-linear effects\nreduce the range of scales over which beta can be fitted, and introduce\ncovariances between nearby modes in addition to those introduced by the\nconvolution with the survey window function. The result is that we are only\nable to constrain beta to a 1-sigma accuracy of 25% (beta=0.55 +/- 0.14 for the\ncosmological model considered). We explore one possible means of reducing this\nerror, that of cluster collapse, and show that accurate application of this\nmethod can greatly reduce the effect of non-linearities, improving the\ndetermination of beta. We conclude by demonstrating that, when the\ncontaminating effects of clusters are dealt with, this simple analysis of the\nfull 2dF survey yields beta=0.55 +/- 0.04. For this model this represents a\ndetermination of beta to an accuracy of 8% and hence an important constraint on\nthe cosmological density parameter Omega_0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 1999 17:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 1999 17:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The spin wave with in-plane\noscillations of antiferromagnetism vector was considered. In this case the\nmagnetization vector is oscillating being perpendicular to the AFM plate and\ndepends on time and plane coordinates as travelling wave does. This model\nallows to obtain exact analytical expression for Hertzian vector and,\nconsequently, the retarded potentials and field strengths as well. It is shown\nthat expressions obtained describe Cherenkov radiation caused by the travelling\nwave. The radiated electromagnetic wave is the TEM type if a phase velocity\nexceeds the speed of light. Otherwise electric and magnetic field values\nexponentially decrease in the direction normal to the plate.
