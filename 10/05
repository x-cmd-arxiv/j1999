In this paper we\nexplore the possibility that black holes become members of close binaries via\ndynamical interactions with other stars in dense stellar systems. In star\nclusters, black holes become the most massive objects within a few tens of\nmillions of years; dynamical relaxation then causes them to sink to the cluster\ncore, where they form binaries. These black-hole binaries become more tightly\nbound by superelastic encounters with other cluster members, and are ultimately\nejected from the cluster. The majority of escaping black-hole binaries have\norbital periods short enough and eccentricities high enough that the emission\nof gravitational radiation causes them to coalesce within a few billion years.\nWe predict a black-hole merger rate of about $1.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ per year per\ncubic megaparsec, implying gravity wave detection rates substantially greater\nthan the corresponding rates from neutron star mergers.

From the various, completely solvable,\nmodels that have been discussed in the literature we choose those that we\nconsider as most suitable for our pedagogical reasons, namely 2+1 gravity and\nthe spherically symmetric model. The former model arises from a dimensional,\nthe latter from a Killing reduction of full 3+1 gravity. While 2+1 gravity is\nusually treated in terms of closed topologies without boundary of the initial\ndata hypersurface, the toplogy for the spherically symmetric system is chosen\nto be asymptotically flat. Finally, 2+1 gravity is more suitably quantized\nusing the loop representation while spherically symmetric gravity is easier to\nquantize via the self-dual representation. Accordingly, both types of\nreductions, both types of topologies and both types of representations that are\nmainly employed in the literature in the context of the new variables come into\npractice. What makes the discussion especially clear is the fact that for both\nmodels the reduced phase space turns out to be finitely dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 1999 17:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
