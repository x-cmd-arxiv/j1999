The crossed electric and\nmagnetic fields, E x B, cause electrons to drift parallel to the sample\nboundary creating a chiral current that travels along the edge in only one\ndirection. Remarkably, in an ideal 2DES in the quantum Hall regime all current\nflows along the edge$^{4-6}$. Quantization of the Hall resistance, $R_{xy}=\nh/Ne^{2}$, arises from occupation of N 1D edge channels, each contributing a\nconductance of $e^{2}/h^{7-11}$. To explore this unusual one-dimensional\nproperty of an otherwise two-dimensional system, we have studied tunneling\nbetween the edges of 2DESs in the regime of integer quantum Hall effect (QHE).\nIn the presence of an atomically precise, high-quality tunnel barrier, the\nresultant interaction between the edge states leads to the formation of new\nenergy gaps and an intriguing dispersion relation for electrons traveling along\nthe barrier. The absence of tunneling features due to the electron spin and the\npersistence of a conductance peak at zero bias are not consistent with a model\nof weakly interacting edge states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 1999 00:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that the wave\nkinetic equation describing the interaction of the small scale turbulence and\nlarge scale shear flow can be naturally written in terms of these invariants.\nUnlike the wave energy, which is conserved as a sum of small- and large- scale\ncomponents, the generalized action invariant is shown to correspond to a\nquantity which is conserved for the small scale component alone. This invariant\ncan be used to construct canonical variables leading to a different definition\nof the wave action (as compared to the case without shear flow). It is\nsuggested that these new canonical action variables form a natural basis for\nthe description of the drift wave turbulence with a mean shear flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 1999 17:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In terms of a quasi-linear formulation, a\nkinetic (Fokker-Planck) equation for the electron energy distribution is\nderived, comprising an energy diffusion coefficient based on gyroresonant\nelectron-whistler-mode wave interaction and parallel wave propagation; a source\nterm representing substorm-produced (lower energy) seed electrons; and a loss\nterm representing electron precipitation due to pitch-angle scattering by\nwhistler-mode waves and EMIC waves.
