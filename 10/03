The\ndistinction was not clear in extended Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. The\nskeleton tree formalism is a natural extension of the peak theory which is an\nalternative formalism for the statistics of the bound objects. The fluctuation\nfield smoothing with Gaussian filter produces the landscape with adding the\nextra-dimension of the filter resolution scale to the spatial coordinate of the\noriginal fluctuation. In the landscape, some smoothing peaks are nesting into\nthe neighboring peaks at a type of critical points called sloping saddles\nappears, which can be interpreted as merging events of the objects in the\ncontext of the hierarchical structure formation. The topological properties of\nthe landscape can be abstracted in skeleton trees, which consist of line\nprocess of the smoothing peaks and the point process of the sloping saddles.\nAccording to this abstract topological picture, in this paper, we present the\nconcept and the basic results of the skeleton tree formalism to describe (1)\nthe distinction between the accretion and the merger in the hierarchical\nstructure formation from various initial random Gaussian fields; (2) the\ninstantaneous number density of the sloping saddles which gives the\ninstantaneous scale function of the objects with the destruction and\nreformation in the mergers; (3) the rates of the destruction, the reformation,\nand the relative accretion growth; (4) the self-consistency of the formalism\nfor the statistics of the mass growth processes of the objects; (5) the mean\ngrowth history of the objects at the fixed mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 1999 16:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Following the launch of a ``successful'' shock by\nthe usual neutrino powered mechanism, the inner layers of the star move\noutwards, but lack adequate energy to eject all the matter exterior to the\nneutron star. Over a period of minutes to hours a variable amount of mass,\nabout 0.1 to 5 solar masses falls back into the collapsed remnant, often\nturning it into a black hole and establishing an accretion disk. The accretion\nrate, about 0.001 to 0.01 solar masses per second, is inadequate to produce a\njet mediated by neutrino annihilation, but similar to that invoked in\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We thus consider\nthe effect of jets formed by ``fallback'' in stars that are already in the\nprocess of exploding. We justify a parameterization of the jet power as a\nconstant times the mass accretion rate, $\\epsilon \\dot {\\rm M} c^2$, and\nexplore the consequences of $\\epsilon$ = 0.001 and 0.01. In supergiants, shock\nbreakout produces bright x-ray transients that might be a diagnostic of the\nmodel. Jets produced by fallback should be more frequent than those made by the\nprompt formation of a black hole and may power the most common form of\ngamma-ray transient in the universe, although not the most common form seen so\nfar by BATSE. Those are still attributed to prompt black hole formation, but it\nmay be that the diverse energies observed for GRBs so far reflect chiefly the\nvariable collimation of the jet inside the star and a consequently highly\nvariable fraction of relativistic ejecta. Indeed, these events may all have a\ncommon total energy near 10$^{52}$ erg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 1999 21:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

However, there has been no theoretical model\nwhich explains the following important correlations; 1) weaker optical Fe II\nemitters always have wider emission-line widths but stronger optical Fe II\nemitters have either wider or narrower line widths, and 2) S1s with wider line\nwidths always have flatter soft X-ray spectra but S1s with narrower line widths\nhave either steeper or flatter soft X-ray spectra.\n  Photoionization models predict that the partly-ionized zone in the broad line\nregion (BLR) with a disk-like configuration, in which the optical Fe II\nemission is thought to arise, is very optically thick. If we observe this\ndisk-like BLR from an inclined viewing angle, the Fe II emitting region located\nin the far-side half disk cannot be seen entirely because of the large optical\ndepth while almost all the Hbeta emission can be seen because the ionized\nhydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of BLR clouds. This explains that the\nFe II/Hbeta ratio depends on viewing angle.\n  Recent discovery of relativistic outflows in some NLS1s suggests that the\nnuclear radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas very close to the\ncentral engine. The kinetic Doppler effect increases the soft X-ray\nluminosities if we observe S1s from a nearly pole-on view given the above range\nof beta. These explain why NLS1s tend to have steeper soft X-ray spectra\ntogether with higher soft X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, the extinction of\nsoft X-ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to more\nserious for the BLS1s than for the NLS1s. We thus suggest that these\norientation effects are responsible for the second important correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 1999 07:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
