In the particular case when $\\alpha(F) = 0$, i.e.\nwhen the HDP and LDP coexist with each other, the second moment of the phase\nboundary displacement is shown to grow with time sublinearly, $\\bar{X^2(t)} =\n\\gamma t^{1/2}$, where the prefactor $\\gamma$ is also calculated explicitly.\nOur analytical predictions are shown to be in a very good agreement with the\nresults of Monte Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 1999 17:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This implies that many sequences must map onto\ncountable number of basins in the structure space. The number of sequences for\nwhich a given fold emerges as a native structure is further reduced by the dual\nrequirements of stability and kinetic accessibility. The factor that determines\nthe dual requirement is related to the sequence dependent temperatures,\nT_\\theta (collapse transition temperature) and T_F (folding transition\ntemperature).
