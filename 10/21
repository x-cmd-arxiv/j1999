Recent progress in numerical\ntechniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a such\naccuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters of\ngalaxies. Dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,\ncan be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the dark\nmatter. For the standard LCDM model we find that the correlation function and\nthe power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scales\nr<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc. The biases depend on scale, redshift, and\ncircular velocities of selected halos. Two processes seem to define the\nevolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias (or peak bias) and merger\nbias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces the\nnumber of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).\nThere are two kinds of velocity bias. The pair-wise velocity bias is\nb_12=0.6-0.8 at r<5Mpc/h, z=0.

As the\nvolume fractions of the two lipids vary, we find that inverted hexagonal,\ngyroid, or lamellar phases are formed. We demonstrate that the non-lamellar\nforming lipid is found preferentially at locations which are difficult for the\nlipid tails to reach. Variations in the volume fraction of each type of lipid\ntail are on the order of one to ten per cent within regions dominated by the\ntails. We also show that the variation in volume fraction is correlated\nqualitatively with the variation in mean curvature of the head-tail interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 1999 17:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2000 20:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Over the last few years, there have been an\nincreasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or\ncollaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd\nPick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top\nof legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are\ncompletely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus,\ntheir framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react\nwhen the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In\nthis paper, we propose the concept of a \\emph{probabilistic agent program} and\nshow how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may\nbuild a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports\ndecision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative\nsemantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics,\nthough more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide\nsound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \\emph{positive} agent\nprograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 1999 09:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
