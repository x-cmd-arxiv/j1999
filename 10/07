We\npropose that when the proportion of refractory elements locked up in dust\ngrains is less than about 50 percent, it is plausible to assume an\napproximately uniform level of depletion for all grain constituents and, by\napplying a small dust correction, recover the intrisic abundances of Si and Mn.\nWe use this approach on a small sample of damped systems for which it is\nappropriate, with the aim of comparing the metallicity dependence of the ratios\n[Si/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] with analogous measurements in Milky Way stars. The main\nconclusion is that the relative abundances of both elements in distant galaxies\nare broadly in line with expectations based on Galactic data. Si displays a\nmild enhancement at low metallicities, as expected for an alpha-capture\nelement, but there are also examples of near-solar [Si/Fe] at [Fe/H] < -1. The\nunderabundance of Mn at low metallicities is possibly even more pronounced than\nthat in metal-poor stars, and no absorption system has yet been found where\n[Mn/Fe] is solar.

From a theoretical point of view, the studies dedicated to the\nself-affine interfaces generated by growth models can be considered to follow\ntwo main branches. The studies about the properties of discrete models and the\nstudies about continuous models. The first ones where dedicated mainly to the\nstudy of the properties of computational models in which the growth proceeds on\nan initially empty lattice representing a d-dimensional substrate. At each time\nstep, the height of the lattice sites is increased by units (usually one unit)\nrepresenting the incoming particles. Different models only differs on the\nrelaxation mechanisms proposed to capture specific experimental\ncharacteristics. Then, the models are classified according to the values of the\nscaling exponents in several universality classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 1999 18:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When the effective dissipation is strong enough, this\nmay lead to the `inelastic collapse', i.e. the divergence of the collision\nfrequency of some particles. The cluster growth is an interesting physical\nphenomenon, whereas the inelastic collapse is an intrinsic effect of the\ninelastic hard sphere (IHS) model used to study the cluster growth - involving\nonly a negligible number of particles in the system. Here, we extend the IHS\nmodel by introducing an elastic contact energy and the related contact duration\nt_c. This avoids the inelastic collapse and allows to examine the long-time\nbehavior of the system. For a quantitative description of the cluster growth,\nwe propose a burning - like algorithm in continuous space, that readily\nidentifies all particles that belong to the same cluster. The criterion for\nthis is here chosen to be only the particle distance.\n  With this method we identify three regimes of behavior. First, for short\ntimes a homogeneous cooling state (HCS) exists, where a mean-field theory works\nnicely, and the clusters are tiny and grow very slowly. Second, at a certain\ntime which depends on the system's properties, cluster growth starts and the\nclusters increase in size and mass until, in the third regime, the system size\nis reached and most of the particles are collected in one huge cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 1999 22:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Whereas\nSalecker and Wigner sought an operative definition of distances suitable for\nthe Planck regime, the analysis in gr-qc/9909017 relies on several assumptions\nthat appear to be natural in the context of most present-day experiments but\nare not even meaningful in the Planck regime. Moreover, contrary to the claim\nmade in gr-qc/9909017, a relevant quantum uncertainty which is used in the\nSalecker-Wigner derivation cannot be truly eliminated; unsurprisingly, it can\nonly be traded for another comparable contribution to the total uncertainty in\nthe measurement. I also comment on the role played by the Salecker-Wigner limit\nin my recent proposal of interferometry-based tests of quantum properties of\nspace-time, which was incorrectly described in gr-qc/9909017. In particular, I\nemphasize that, as discussed in detail in gr-qc/9903080, only some of the\nquantum-gravity ideas that can be probed with modern interferometers are\nmotivated by the Salecker-Wigner limit. The bulk of the insight we can expect\nfrom such interferometric studies concerns the properties of \"foamy\" models of\nspace-time, which are intrinsically interesting independently of the\nSalecker-Wigner limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 1999 20:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We worked in the\nLF gauge $A^+=0$ and used the old-fashioned LFQCD perturbation theory in our\ncalculations. The importance of our work are summarized below.\n  Our approach shares the intution of parton model and addresses directly the\nstructure functions, which are experimental objects, instead of its moments as\nin OPE method. Moreover, it can potentially incorporate the non-perturbative\ncontents of the structure functions as we have demonstrated by introducing a\nnew factorization scheme.\n  In the context of nucleonic helicity structure, the well known gauge fixed LF\nhelicity operator is shown to provide consistent physical information and helps\nus defining new relevant structure functions. The anomalous dimensions relevant\nfor the $Q^2$-evolution of such structure functions are calculated.\n  Our study is important in establishing the equivalance of LF field theory and\nthe usual equal-time one through perturbative calculations of the dressed\nparton structure functions reproducing the well known results.

For this latter theory we compare our results with those of\nother works in the literature which employ the derivative expansion but find a\nuniquely defined thermal effective potential. We raise several questions\nconcerning the interchange of the order of the perturbative and the derivative\nexpansions, the thermal generalization of some non-perturbative zero\ntemperature methods and the use of the periodicity of the external bosonic\nfield. Finally, we re-examine the physical interpretation given to the\nimaginary part of the thermal bubble in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 1999 14:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2000 14:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, perfect teleportation of two non-orthogonal input states\nrequires the same amount of entanglement as perfect teleportation of an unknown\nstate, namely one ebit. We analyse how well two-state teleportation can be\nachieved using every degree of pure-state entanglement, and discuss the\nfidelity of `teleportation' that can be achieved with only classical\ncommunication but no shared entanglement. A two-state telecloning scheme is\nconstructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 1999 17:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2000 11:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
