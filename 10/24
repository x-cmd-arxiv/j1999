Among its numerous interesting traits,\nTriton appears to have far fewer craters than would be expected if its surface\nwas primordial. Here we combine the best available crater count data for Triton\nwith improved estimates of impact rates by including the Kuiper Belt as a\nsource of impactors. We find that the population of impactors creating the\nsmallest observed craters on Triton must be sub-km in scale, and that this\nsmall-impactor population can be best fit by a differential power-law size\nindex near -3. Such results provide interesting, indirect probes of the unseen\nsmall body population of the Kuiper Belt. Based on the modern, Kuiper Belt and\nOort Cloud impactor flux estimates, we also recalculate estimated ages for\nseveral regions of Triton's surface imaged by Voyager 2, and find that Triton\nwas probably active on a time scale no greater than 0.1-0.3 Gyr ago (indicating\nTriton was still active after some 90% to 98% of the age of the solar system),\nand perhaps even more recently. The time-averaged volumetric resurfacing rate\non Triton implied by these results, 0.01 km$^3$ yr$^{-1}$ or more, is likely\nsecond only to Io and Europa in the outer solar system, and is within an order\nof magnitude of estimates for Venus and for the Earth's intraplate zones. This\nfinding indicates that Triton likely remains a highly geologically active world\nat present, some 4.5 Gyr after its formation. We briefly speculate on how such\na situation might obtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 1999 12:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is found that the\nspontaneous violation of the CP symmetry can occur in the Higgs sector of the\nNMSSM for a wide region of the parameter space of the model, at the 1-loop\nlevel where the radiative corrections due to the top quark and scalar-top quark\nloops are found to generate the scalar-pseudoscalar mixings between the two\nHiggs doublets of the NMSSM. In our model, we assume that the masses of the\nleft-handed and the right-handed scalar-top quarks are not degenerate. And we\ninvestigate our model anaytically: We derive analytical formulae of the 1-loop\nmass matrix for the neutral Higgs bosons. We calculate the upper bound on the\nlightest neutral Higgs boson mass under the assumption. It is found to be about\n140 GeV for our choice of parameter values in the presence of the spontaneous\nviolation of the CP symmetry in the NMSSM. Thus, the possibility of the\nspontaneous violation of the CP symmetry is not completely ruled out in the\nHiggs sector of the NMSSM if the masses of the left-handed and the right-handed\nscalar-top quarks are not degenerate. Further, the phenomenology of the\n$K$-${\\bar K}$ mixing within the context of our model is studied.
