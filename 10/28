We are aided, however, by the fact that many H- and\nHe-deficient pre-white dwarfs (PWDs) are multiperiodic g-mode pulsators.\nPulsations in PWDs provide a unique opportunity to probe their interiors, which\nare otherwise inaccesible to direct observation. Until now, however, the nature\nof the pulsation mechanism, the precise boundaries of the instability strip,\nand the mass distribution of the PWDs were complete mysteries. These problems\nmust be addressed before we can apply knowledge of pulsating PWDs to improve\nunderstanding of white dwarf formation. This paper lays the groundwork for\nfuture theoretical investigations of these stars. In recent years, Whole Earth\nTelescope observations led to determination of mass and luminosity for the\nmajority of the (non-central star) PWD pulsators. With these observations, we\nidentify the common properties and trends PWDs exhibit as a class. We find that\npulsators of low mass have higher luminosity, suggesting the range of\ninstability is highly mass-dependent. The observed trend of decreasing periods\nwith decreasing luminosity matches a decrease in the maximum (standing-wave)\ng-mode period across the instability strip. We show that the red edge can be\ncaused by the lengthening of the driving timescale beyond the maximum\nsustainable period. This result is general for ionization-based driving\nmechanisms, and it explains the mass-dependence of the red edge. The observed\nform of the mass-dependence provides a vital starting point for future\ntheoretical investigations of the driving mechanism. We also show that the blue\nedge probably remains undetected because of selection effects arising from\nrapid evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 1999 17:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In\ntwo dimensions, weakly disordered systems of this kind may possess a metallic\nphase beyond the insulating phases expected for strong disorder. We show that\nthe 2d metal phase emanates from the free Majorana fermion point, in the\ndirection of the RG trajectory of a perturbed WZW model. To establish this\nresult, we develop a supersymmetric extension of the method of nonabelian\nbosonization. On the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition, the\ndensity of states becomes nonvanishing at zero energy, by a mechanism akin to\ndynamical mass generation. This feature is explored in a model of N species of\ndisordered Dirac fermions, via the mapping on a nonlinear sigma model, which\nencapsulates a Z_2 spin degree of freedom. We compute the density of states in\na finite system, and obtain agreement with the random-matrix prediction for\nclass D, in the ergodic limit. Vortex disorder, which is a relevant\nperturbation at the free-fermion point, changes the density of states at low\nenergy and suppresses the local Z_2 degree of freedom, thereby leading to a\ndifferent symmetry class, BD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 1999 15:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2000 13:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2000 20:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The tool that I employ is lattice gauge simulation.\nThe observable from which the spectrum of the Hamiltonian in presence of two\nstatic quarks can be extracted, is a matrix correlation whose elements are\nconstructed not only from string-type states represented by Wilson loops (like\nin pure gauge theories). Additional matrix elements representing transitions\nfrom string-type to meson-type states and the propagation of meson-type states\nare taken into account. From this basis of states it is possible to extract the\nground state and first excited state static potentials employing a variational\nmethod. The crossing of these two energy levels in the string breaking region\nis clearly visible and the inadequacy of the Wilson loops alone can be\ndemonstrated. I also address the question of the lattice artifacts. For this\npurpose lines of constant physics in the confinement ``phase'' of the model\nhave to be constructed.
