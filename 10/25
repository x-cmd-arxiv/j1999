The model is by necessity,\napproximate, though it does incorporate the important symmetries of the\nunderlying field theory. The model also reproduces classical results in the\nappropriate limits. We find that generic instanton ensembles lead to an\naccumulation of eigenvalues around zero, and hence, break chiral symmetry. The\neigenvalue spectrum is divergent however, as the eigenvalue approaches zero.\nThis leads to a divergent chiral condensate in quenched QCD, and hence, shows\nthe theory to be pathological. In full QCD we find the novel result of a\ndivergent spectral density leading to chiral symmetry breaking, but, with a\nfinite condensate. This result holds for both $N_{f}=1$ and $N_{f}=2$. We also\ncompute correlation functions and find a massive $\\eta^{'}$ and $\\sigma$ in the\nchiral limit. Whilst the divergence follows a power law, the strength of the\ndivergence is inversely proportional to the instanton density. To investigate\nthe impact of the divergence further, we analyse instanton ensembles derived by\n\"cooling\" lattice gauge configurations. An important negative result is that\nthe chiral condensate is strongly dependent upon the number of cooling sweeps\nperformed. Whether the problem lies with cooling or with the identification of\ntopological objects is yet to be resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 1999 16:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
