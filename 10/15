The high-ionization nuclear emission-line region (HINER) traced by\n[Fe X]6374 is found to be spatially extended to a radius of 3a rcseconds (150\npc) west and southwest from the nucleus; NGC 4051 is the third example which\nhas an extended HINER.\n  The nuclear spectrum shows that the flux of [Fe X]6374 is stronger than that\nof [Fe VII] 6087 in our observation. This property cannot be interpreted in\nterms of a simple one-zone photoionization model.\n  In order to understand what happens in the nuclear region in NGC 4051, we\ninvestigate the physical condition of the nuclear emission-line region in\ndetail using new photoionization models in which the following three\nemission-line components are taken into account; (1) optically thick,\nionization-bounded clouds; (2) optically thin, matter-bounded clouds; and (3) a\ncontamination component which emits H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines. Here the\nobserved extended HINER is considered to be associated with the low-density,\nmatter-bounded clouds. Candidates of the contamination component are either the\nbroad-line region (BLR) or nuclear star forming regions or both. The complexity\nof the excitation condition found in NGC 4051 can be consistently understood if\nwe take account of these contamination components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 1999 12:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The ratio of these two scale\nparameters contains information on the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid,\ni.e. the ratio of the vertical to radial stellar velocity dispersions of the\nstars, at least at some fiducial distance from the center. The radial velocity\ndispersion correlates well with the amplitude of the rotation curve and with\nthe disk integrated magnitude, as was found by Bottema (1993). These relations\ncan be understood as the result of the stellar disk being (marginally) stable\nagainst local instabilities at all length scales. This is expressed by Toomre's\nwell-known criterion, which relates the sheer in the rotation to a minimum\nvalue that the radial stellar velocity dispersion should have for stability for\na given surface density. Via the Tully-Fisher (1977) relation, the velocity\ndispersion then becomes related to the integrated magnitude and hence to the\nscale length. The vertical velocity dispersion relates directly to the scale\nheight through hydrostatic equilibrium. It can be shown that the ratio of the\ntwo length scales relates to the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid only\nthrough the Toomre parameter Q and in particular does not require a choice of\nthe mass-to-light ratio or a distance scale.\n  We have applied this to the statistically complete sample of edge-on\ngalaxies, for which de Grijs (1997) has performed surface photometry and has\ndetermined the length scales in the stellar light distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 1999 14:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
