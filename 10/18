Observations at four epochs were\nobtained, and images were produced at three of these. During the event the\nsource consisted of a dominant, compact component, essentially identical to the\nstructure seen outside the event. However, the source's diameter increased\nslightly at 13 cm during the ESE. An increase in the source's diameter is\ninconsistent with a simple refractive model. We also see no evidence for\nESE-induced substructure within the source or the formation of multiple images,\nas would occur in a strongly refractive lens. However, a model in which the\ndecrease in flux density during the ESE occurs solely because of stochastic\nbroadening within the lens requires a larger broadening diameter during the ESE\nthan is observed. Thus, the ESE toward 1741-038 involved both stochastic\nbroadening and refractive defocussing within the lens. If the structure\nresponsible for the ESE has a size of order 1 AU, the level of scattering\nwithin an ESE lens may be a factor of 10^7 larger than that in the ambient\nmedium. A filamentary structure could reduce the difference between the\nstrength of scattering in the lens and ambient medium, but we conclude that, if\nESEs arise from filamentary structures, they occur when the filamentary\nstructures are seen lengthwise. We predict the amount of pulse broadening that\nwould result from a comparable lens passing in front of a pulsar. The pulse\nbroadening would be no more than 1.1 microseconds, consistent with the lack of\npulse broadening detected during ESEs toward the pulsars PSR B1937+21 and PSR\nJ1643-1224.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 1999 15:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2000 12:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
