The sixth, the rich globular\ncluster, Liller 1, had heretofore been undetected in the radio, and the\nseventh, 47 Tucanae, was not included in our original survey. High resolution 6\nand 20 cm images of three of the clusters, NGC 6440, NGC 6539, NGC 6624 reveal\nonly point sources coincident with pulsars which have been discovered\nsubsequent to our first imaging survey. 21 and 18 cm images reveal several\npoint sources within a few core-radii of the center of 47 Tuc. Two of these are\nidentified pulsars, and a third, which is both variable and has a steep\nspectrum, is also most likely a pulsar previously identified by a pulsed\nsurvey. However, the 6, 20 and 90 cm images of NGC 6544, Liller 1 and Terzan 5\ndisplay strong steep-spectrum emission which cannot be associated with known\npulsars. The image of the rich cluster Terzan 5 displays numerous point sources\nwithin $30''$, or 4 core radii of the cluster center. The density of these\nobjects rises rapidly toward the core, where an elongated region of emission is\nfound. The brightest individual sources, as well as the extended emission,\npossess the steep spectra expected of pulsars. Furthermore, the flux\ndistribution of the sources agrees well with the standard pulsar luminosity\nfunction. The total luminosity and number of objects observed suggest that\nTerzan 5 contains more pulsars than any other Galactic globular cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 1999 22:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Through the decomposition of the luminosity profiles and\nthe analysis of the structural profiles (ellipticity, PA, c4) of the galaxies\nwe are able to characterize in detail the optical properties of the radio\ngalaxies. The average absolute magnitude is M_HOST(tot)=-24.0 with a clear\ntrend for FRI sources to be 0.5 mag brighter than FRII galaxies. In about 40%\nof the objects observed we find an excess of light in the nucleus that is\nattributed to the presence of a nuclear point source whose luminosity is on\naverage 1-2% of the total flux of the host galaxy. The luminosity of these\nnuclear point sources appears correlated with the core radio power of the\ngalaxies. Radio galaxies follow the same mu_e - R_e relationship as normal\nelliptical galaxies. The distribution of ellipticity, the amount of twisting\nand shape of isophotes (boxy,disky) do not differ significantly from other\nellipticals. The evidence for recent interactions is therefore rather modest.\nFinally on average radio galaxies are bluer and have a color dispersion larger\nthan normal elliptical galaxies, and the average color gradient in radio\ngalaxies appears slightly steeper than in normal ellipticals. These results\nsupport a scenario where radio emission is weakly related with the overall\nproperties and/or the activity have negligible effects on the global\ncharacteristics of the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 1999 13:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A weak attraction should manifest itself strongly in\n1D systems, since it can create two-electron bound states. This paper\ninterprets the 0.7 $(2e^2/h)$ conductance structure, observed recently in a\none-dimensional constriction, as a manifestation of two-electron bound states\nformed in a barrier saddle-point. The value 0.75 $(2e^2/h)$ follows naturally\nfrom the 3:1 triplet-singlet statistical weight ratio for the two-electron\nbound states, if the triplet energy is lower. Furthermore, the value 0.75 has\nto be multiplied by the probability T of the bound state formation during\nadiabatic transmission of two electrons into 1D channel ($T\\simeq 1$). If the\nbinding energy is larger than the sub-band energy spacing the 0.7 structure can\nbe seen even when the integer steps are smeared away by the temperature. Bound\nstates of several electrons, if they exist, may give different steps at 1/2,\n5/16, 3/16 etc in the conductance. The latter results are sensitive to the\nlength of 1D system and the electron density at the barrier. It is not excluded\nthat the fractional conductance quantization may also appear for a repulsive\ninteraction between electrons. In this case the electron level splitting is due\nto the exchange interaction with two nearest neighbors in a 1D Wigner crystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 1999 11:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
