Previous authors noted that an accreted\ncrust, being formed from the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium, allows a\nseries of non-equilibrium reactions, at densities >6e11 g/cc, which release a\nsubstantial amount of heat (1 MeV per accreted nucleon). Recent calculations by\nSchatz et al. showed that the crystalline lattice of an accreted crust is also\nlikely to be quite impure. This paper discusses the thermal structure of such a\nneutron star and surveys how the crust reactions and impurities affect the\ncrust temperature. During accretion rapid enough to make the accreted hydrogen\nand helium burn stably (near the Eddington accretion rate; typical of the\nbrightest low-mass neutron star binaries), most of the heat released in the\ncrust is conducted into the core, where neutrino emission regulates the\ntemperature. As a result there is an inversion of the thermal gradient: the\ntemperature decreases with depth in the inner crust. The thermal structure in\nthe crust at these high accretion rates is insensitive to the temperature in\nthe hydrogen/helium burning shell. When the crust is very impure, the\ntemperature can reach approximately 8e8 K at densities > 6e11 g/cc. This peak\ntemperature depends mostly on the amount of heat released and the thermal\nconductivity and in particular is roughly independent of the core temperature.\nThe high crust temperatures are sufficient to melt the crystalline lattice in\nthin layers where electron captures have substantially reduced the nuclear\ncharge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 1999 16:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We compare these results with redshift space mock\ncatalogues constructed from high resolution N-body simulations of two Cold Dark\nMatter models with either a decaying massive neutrino (tauCDM) or a non-zero\ncosmological constant (LambdaCDM). We use semi-analytic modelling to form and\nevolve galaxies in these dark matter-only simulations. We are thus able, for\nthe first time, to compile redshift space mock catalogues which contain\ngalaxies, along with their observable properties, rather than dark matter\nparticles alone. In both models the large scale galaxy distribution is less\ncoherent than the observed distribution, especially with regard to the large\ndegree of planarity of the real survey. However, given the small volume of the\nregion studied, this disagreement can still be a result of cosmic variance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 1999 10:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

But to explain my feeling\nthat we may still have a lot to learn I offer some comments on our sociology,\ninformed by social construction, in adopting lines of thought that tend not to\nfollow straightforward readings of what is observed. Thus galaxies are thought\nto be affected by environment, not only in the morphology-density relation, but\nalso as the cause of biased formation. But the Tully-Fisher and fundamental\nplane relations do not allow much room for the contingencies of environment. It\nis thought that the galaxy distribution is not likely to be closely related to\nthe mass, yet most dynamical analyses indicate that if the mean density is low\nthen optically selected galaxies are good mass tracers. The evidence is that at\nredshift unity the larger spiral and elliptical galaxies were by and large in\nplace, as were a good fraction of the great clusters of galaxies. These\ngalaxies evolve slowly at $z<1$, yet we hears of rapid evolution not much\nbefore this, in galaxy formation. Perhaps all these examples are misleading.\nBut, as Kuhn has taught us, complex interpretations of simple phenomena have\nbeen known to be precursors of paradigm shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 1999 14:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
