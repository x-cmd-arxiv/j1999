We obtain B and\nR CCD images and high-S/N longslit spectra for the resulting sample of 149 void\ngalaxies, and also for 131 galaxies on the periphery of these voids.\n  Here we describe the photometry for the sample, including B isophotal\nmagnitudes and B-R colors. For the 149 galaxies which lie in regions below the\nmean survey density, the luminosity functions in B and R are well-fit by\nSchechter functions with respective parameters (alpha_B = -0.5 +/- 0.3, B_* =\n-18.9 +/- 0.2) and (alpha_R = -0.9 +/- 0.3, R_* = -20.4 +/- 0.3). The B\nluminosity function (LF) is consistent with typical survey LFs (e.g., the\nSouthern Sky Redshift Survey), and the R LF is consistent with the Century\nSurvey. The B and R LFs of 131 galaxies in the ``void periphery'', regions\nbetween the mean density and twice the mean, have similar Schechter parameters.\nThe CfA2 LF is inconsistent with both samples at 3.5-sigma.\n  When we narrow our analysis to the 46 galaxies in regions below half the mean\ndensity, the LF is steeper: alpha = -1.4 +/- 0.5.
