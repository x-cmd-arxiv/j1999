Such a characterization provides insight on galaxy evolution\nbecause there are physical connections between galaxies' stellar populations\nand their light distribution. ``Normal'' galaxies' form-parameters\n(surface-brightness, image concentration and asymmetry) correlate well with\nspectral-index (color), which in turn correlates only weakly with scale (size\nor luminosity). Deviations from these normal relations also offer clues to the\nphysical modes of galaxy formation and evolution. As an example, I contrast a\npuzzling, distant population of compact, but luminous, blue, star-forming\ngalaxies to nearby samples. These distant sources appear to be associated with\nthe bulk of the luminosity increase since z<1. They have structural properties\ncomparable to low-redshift populations, and photometric properties within the\nnorm for nearby, actively star-forming galaxies. When combined, however, their\nphotometric and structural properties appear to be highly unusual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 1999 20:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We use a simplified model: the\ninstantons are a (weighted) gas, the fermionic integrations are restricted to\nthe subspace spanned by the would-be zero-modes and only the dimensional and\nchiral features of the Dirac operator are retained. Previous work along these\nlines found a power-like divergence of the Dirac spectral density at zero\neigenvalue. By changing the various components of the model, we show that a\npower divergence appears to be a generic feature of instanton mixing for both\nNf=0 and Nf=/=0. In the latter case the divergence disappears as m->0 in such a\nway that psibar-psi remains finite. We find that the exponent of the power\ndecreases for larger instanton densities, becoming negligible for very dense\ninstanton `gases'. We reproduce the expected m-dependence of the topological\nsusceptibility, we investigate the space-time structure of the eigenfunctions,\nas a function of the eigenvalue, and we calculate the eta-prime mass. In\nsummary: instantons appear to provide a natural mechanism for the spontaneous\nbreaking of chiral symmetry in QCD, but they typically produce a power-like\ndivergence in the Dirac spectral density. This divergence is non-standard but\n`harmless' in the case of full QCD, and implies a pathology in the case of\nquenched QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 1999 08:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Frobenius map on X induces a rational map on the moduli\nscheme of rank-2 bundles. We show that up to isomorphism, there is only one (up\nto tensoring by an order two line bundle) semi-stable vector bundle of rank 2\n(with determinant equal to a theta characteristic) whose Frobenius pull-back is\nnot semi-stable. The indeterminacy of the Frobenius map at this point can be\nresolved by introducing Higgs bundles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 1999 15:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

After presenting a self-contained derivation\nof the form of the Schiff operator, we show that the distribution of Schiff\nstrength, an important ingredient in the ground-state Schiff moment, is very\ndifferent from the electric-dipole-strength distribution, with the Schiff\nmoment receiving no strength from the giant dipole resonance in the\nGoldhaber-Teller model. We then present shell-model calculations in light\nnuclei that confirm the negligible role of the dipole resonance and show the\nSchiff strength to be strongly correlated with low-lying octupole strength.\nNext, we turn to heavy nuclei, examining recent arguments for the strong\nenhancement of Schiff moments in octupole-deformed nuclei over that of 199Hg,\nfor example. We concur that there is a significant enhancement while pointing\nto effects neglected in previous work (both in the octupole-deformed nuclides\nand 199Hg) that may reduce it somewhat, and emphasizing the need for\nmicroscopic calculations to resolve the issue. Finally, we show that static\noctupole deformation is not essential for the development of collective Schiff\nmoments; nuclei with strong octupole vibrations have them as well, and some\ncould be exploited by experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 1999 22:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
