The optical and ROSAT-PSPC data\nshow a complex morphology with at least two cores. Our SAX observations yield a\ngas temperature kT = 6.46^{+1.74}_{-1.19} keV and a metallicity A =\n0.53^{+0.29}_{-0.24}, with a prominent iron K(alpha) line. The second cluster,\nMS2053.7-0449 at z = 0.58, was selected from the EMSS sample. Given the poor\nstatistics no constraints on the metallicity can be derived from the present\ndata. Large uncertainties are associated to the gas temperature (kT =\n6.7^{+6.8}_{-2.3} keV), which has been obtained after fixing the abundance to\n0.3 solar. Combining these results with those obtained for similarly high\nredshift (z >= 0.5) clusters of galaxies with broad band X-ray spectra, we\ndiscuss the high redshift L(bol) - T relationship. The data can easily be\naccommodated with a non-evolving (or mildly evolving) L(bol) - T relation, a\nresult which, when combined with the little observed evolution in the bulk of\nthe X-ray cluster population, gives support to low Omega cosmological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 1999 12:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
