Computations of the omega and mu-currents in a\n0.8 Mo halo stellar model including classical element settling show that the\nmu-currents are larger (in absolute values) than the omega-currents in all the\nstar : some new physics has thus to be invoked in this case.

As lithium\ndiffuses in the same way as helium, we expect a very small lithium\nconcentration gradient below the convective zone in \"plateau stars\" (main\nsequence PopII stars), much smaller than the one expected for pure element\nsettling. This could possibly account for the very small dispersion observed\nfor the lithium abundances at the surface of these stars.

For a sample of seven resolved spirals we have retrieved a\nmean temperature of 20K, about 10K lower than previous estimates based on IRAS\ndata at shorter wavelengths. Because of the steep dependence of far-infrared\nemission on the dust temperature, the dust masses inferred from ISO fluxes are\na factor of 10 higher than those derived from IRAS data only, leading to\ngas-to-dust ratios close to the value observed in the Galaxy. The scale-length\nof the 200 micron emission is larger than for the IRAS 100 micron emission,\nwith colder dust at larger distances from the galactic centre, as expected if\nthe interstellar radiation field is the main source of dust heating. The 200\nmicron scale-length is also larger than the optical, for all the galaxies in\nthe sample. This suggests that the dust distribution is more extended than that\nof the stars.A model of the dust heating is needed to derive the parameters of\nthe dust distribution from the FIR emission. Therefore, we have adapted an\nexisting radiative transfer code to deal with dust emission. Simulated maps of\nthe temperature distribution within the dust disk and of the dust emission at\nany wavelength can be produced. The stellar spectral energy distribution is\nderived from observations in the ultraviolet, optical and near infrared. The\nparameters of the dust distribution (scale-lengths and optical depth) are\nchosen to reproduce the observed characteristics of the FIR emission, i.e. the\nshape of the spectrum, the flux and the spatial distribution.

We analyze several models of scalar\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics, and show that the Gaussian approximation\ncorrectly distinguishes between a moduli space, mass gap, and supersymmetry\nbreaking at strong coupling. Then we apply the approximation to a bosonic\nlarge-N gauge theory, and argue that a Gross-Witten transition separates the\nweak-coupling and strong-coupling regimes. A similar transition should occur in\na generic large-N gauge theory, in particular in 0-brane quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 1999 04:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2000 20:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In order to maintain electromagnetic current conservation\nit is then necessary to go beyond the impulse approximation. A conserved\ncurrent is obtained by including the coupling of the photon to the exchanged\nquark and direct ``seagull'' couplings to the diquark structure. Adopting a\nsimple dynamical model of constituent quarks and exploring various\nparametrisations of scalar diquark correlations, the nucleon Bethe-Salpeter\nequation is solved and the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors are\ncalculated numerically. The resulting magnetic moments are still about 50% too\nsmall, the improvements necessary to remedy this are discussed. The results\nobtained in this framework provide an excellent description of the electric\nform factors (and charge radii) of the proton, up to a photon momentum transfer\nof 3.5GeV^2, and the neutron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 1999 17:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2000 18:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
