The central condensation is a disk of about\n1 kpc radius with a molecular gas mass of 2 x 10^9 M_sun.

This bar is expected to connect the nuclear disk and the ring\nalong the position angle of the northwest stream. A position-velocity cut in\nthis direction reveals features which match the characteristic motions of gas\nin a barred potential. Our model indicates that gas in the northwest stream is\non an x_1 orbit at the bar's leading edge; it is falling into the nucleus with\na large noncircular velocity, and will eventually contribute about 2 x 10^8\nM_sun to the nuclear disk.

The cross\ncorrelation function shows a positive peak when the optical variations lead the\nX-rays by about 100 days. We show that the putative correlation signal at 100\ndays is entirely due to the slow ($\\gtorder 30$ days) components of the light\ncurves.

The detection of\nthis lag is tentative and the significance of the correlation uncertain. If the\n100-day delay is real, however, one interpretation is that that the\nslowly-varying part of the X-ray emission is an echo of the optical emission,\nCompton scattered from a medium located about 50-100 lt days from the optical\nsource. We point out that a possibly analogous phenomenon, of a lag between\nhard and soft X-rays for a given variability timescale, exists in Galactic\nstellar-mass accretors. Remarkably, in both cases the lag corresponds to a\nlight travel distance of order $10^4$ gravitational radii. Alternatively, the\nlag may not represent a physical size, but for example, the timescale of an\ninstability propagating inward in an accretion flow, appearing first in the\noptical and then in the X-rays.

Detailed analytical and\nexplicit expressions are given when the coupling of the two modes has an\nharmonic time-dependence. Despite its simplicity the model exhibits a very\nbroad range of intricate physical effects. We show that quantum revivals are\npossible for a broad continuous range of physical parameters in the case of\ninitial Fock states. For coherent states we find that such revivals are\npossible only for certain discrete rational number combinations of the ratio of\nfrequency detuning and pump parameters. Correlation effects are shown to be\nvery sensitive to the initial state of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 1999 19:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
