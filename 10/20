The disk model uses the observed stratifications for the\ngas density and gravitational acceleration at the solar neighborhood and, in\nthis sense, it can be called a realistic model. The distribution of the total\ngas pressure is defined by these observed stratifications, and the gaseous disk\nis assumed isothermal. The initial magnetic field is taken parallel to the\ndisk, with a midplane value of 5 $\\mu$G, and its stratification along the\nz-axis is derived from the condition of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium in an\nisothermal atmosphere. The resulting isothermal sound speed is $\\sim 8.4$ km\ns$^{-1}$, similar to the velocity dispersion of the main gas components within\n1.5 kpc from midplane. The thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio decreases with\n$[z]$ and the warm model is Parker unstable. The dispersion relations show that\nthe fastest growing mode has a wavelength of about 3 kpc, for both symmetric\nand antisymmetric perturbations, and the corresponding growth time scales are\nof about $3\\times 10^7$ years. The structure of the final equilibrium stage is\nalso derived, and we find that the midplane antisymmetric (MA) mode gathers\nmore gas in the magnetic valleys. The resulting MA gas condensations have\nlarger densities, and the column density enhancement is a factor of about 3\nlarger than the value of the initial stage. The unstable wavelengths and growth\ntimes for the multi-component disk model are substantially larger than those of\na thin disk model, and some of the implications of these results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 1999 12:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
