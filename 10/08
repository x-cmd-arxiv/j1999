High velocity emission have been only detected\nin two regions: BN/KL (IRc2/I) and Orion-S.\n  The Orion-S region contains a very young (dynamical age of 10^3years), very\nfast (~110kms^-1) and very compact (<0.16pc) bipolar outflow. From the\nmorphology of the high-velocity gas we estimate that the position of the\npowering source must be ~20'' north of FIR4. For the IRc2/I molecular outflow\nthe morphology of the moderate velocity (<60kms^-1) gas shows a weak bipolarity\naround IRc2/I. The gas at the most extreme velocities does not show any\nbipolarity around IRc2/I, if any, it is found ~30'' north from these sources.\nThe blue and redshifted gas at moderate velocities shows similar spatial\ndistribution with a systematic trend for the size of the high-velocity gas to\ndecrease as the terminal radial velocity increases. The size-velocity\nrelationship is fitted with a simple velocity law which considers a highly\ncollimated jet and entrained material outside the jet moving in the radial\ndirection. We also find that most of the CO outflowing at moderate velocities\nis located at the head of the jet. Our results and the spatial distribution and\nkinematics of the shock tracers in this outflow can be explained if the IRc2/I\noutflow is driven by a precessing jet oriented along the line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 1999 10:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Different protocols are presented for implementing two-qubits\nquantum logic gates such as the controlled-phase and swap gate. We analyze the\nfidelity of our gate designs, imperfect due to decoherence from cooperative\nspontaneous emission and coherent couplings outside the logical basis. Outlines\nfor extending our model to include the full molecular interactions potentials\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 1999 20:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

However, few proposals exist\nfor robust, solid state implementation of such computers where the quantum\ngates are sufficiently miniaturized to have nanometer-scale dimensions. Here I\npresent a new approach whereby a complete computer with nanoscale gates might\nbe self-assembled using chemical synthesis. Specifically, I demonstrate how to\nself-assemble the fundamental unit of this quantum computer - a 2-qubit\nuniversal quantum controlled-NOT gate - based on two exchange coupled\nmultilayered quantum dots. Then I show how these gates can be wired using\nthiolated conjugated molecules as electrical connectors. A qubit is encoded in\nthe ground state of a quantum dot spin-split by the Rashba interaction.\nArbitrary qubit rotations are effected by bringing the spin splitting energy in\na target quantum dot in resonance with a global ac magnetic field by applying a\npotential pulse of appropriate amplitude and duration to the dot. The\ncontrolled dynamics of the 2-qubit controlled-NOT operation (XOR) can be\nrealized by exploiting the exchange coupling with the nearest neighboring dot.\nA complete prescription for initialization of the computer and data\ninput/output operations is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 1999 22:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 1999 23:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 1999 21:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2000 01:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2000 22:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 22:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

An analysis of single measurement\nproblems reveals that the theory is suitable to remove some of the most\nstriking paradoxes in quantum mechanics, which are found to originate from\nobscuring statistical effects with physical reasoning.

In particular,\nhow must different observations be related in order to ensure that predictions\nbecome ever more accurate, the more past observations serve as input?
