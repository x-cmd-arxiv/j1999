The results can be applied both in ordinary flat spacetime in\nthe critical dimension d or in the presence of a generic background for the\nLiouville field. We compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources\nin an abelian gauge theory in relative collinear motion with velocity v =\ntanh(u), probing length scales down to r_min^2 = 2 \\pi \\alpha' u. We predict a\nuniversal -(d-2)/r static interaction at short distances. We show that the\nvelocity dependent corrections to the short distance potential in the bosonic\nstring take the form of an infinite power series in the dimensionless variables\nz = r_min^2/r^2, uz/\\pi, and u^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 1999 22:08:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 1999 22:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 1999 21:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2000 20:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
