The (V-I)_0\nanomaly is partially resolved by using the photometry from the phase-II of the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) rather than phase-I. The need\nfor V- or I-magnitude-based change in the bulge (V-I)_0 is one option to\nexplain the remaining color discrepancy. Such change may originate in a\ncoefficient of selective extinction A_V/E(V-I) smaller than typically assumed.\nApplication of the (V-I)_0 correction (independent of its source) doubles the\nslope of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation for clump giants, so\nthat M_I(RC) = -0.23 + 0.19[Fe/H]. Consequently, the estimates of the clump\ndistances to the LMC and SMC are affected. Udalski's (1998c) distance modulus\nof mu_{LMC} = 18.18 +/- 0.06 increases to mu_{LMC} = 18.27 +/- 0.07.

Therefore, it is often believed that the\nDIA method is not as powerful as the classical method based on the PSF\nphotometry in determining the Einstein time scales $t_{\\rm E}$ of events.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate that the degeneracy problem in microlensing\nevents detectable from the searches by using the DIA method will not be as\nserious as it is often worried about.

The ground state and the excited (Efimov) state\nobtained are compared with other results. The scattering lengths and the\natom-diatom phase shifts were calculated for center of mass energies up to 2.45\nmK. It was found that the LM2M2 and TTY potentials, although of quite different\nstructure, give practically the same bound-state and scattering results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 1999 15:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 1999 19:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
