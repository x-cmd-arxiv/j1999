The planet is assumed to be\nin a circular orbit about the central star and is not allowed to migrate. A gap\nis formed about the orbit of the planet, but there is a nonaxisymmetric flow\nthrough the gap and onto the planet. The gap partitions the disk into an inner\n(outer) disk that extends inside (outside) the planet's orbit. For a 1 M_J\nplanet and typical disk parameters, the accretion through the gap onto the\nplanet is highly efficient. For typical disk parameters, the mass doubling time\nscale is less than 10^5 years, considerably shorter than the disk lifetime.\nFollowing shocks near the L1 and L2 Lagrange points, disk material enters the\nRoche lobe in the form of two gas streams. Shocks occur within the Roche lobe\nas the gas streams collide, and shocks lead to rapid inflow towards the planet\nwithin much of planet's Roche lobe. Shocks also propagate in the inner and\nouter disks that orbit the star. For higher mass planets (of order 6 M_J), the\nflow rate onto the planet is considerably reduced, which suggests an upper mass\nlimit to planets in the range of 10 M_J. This rate reduction is related to the\nfact that the gap width increases relative to the Roche (Hill sphere) radius\nwith increasing planetary mass. The flow in the gap affects planetary\nmigration. For the 1 M_J planet case, mass can penetrate from the outer disk to\nthe inner disk, so that the inner disk is not depleted.

A natural way to achieve this goal\nis to transport the data packet stream on a TCP connection. However, because\nTCP implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet\nstream directly using a TCP connection forces the data packet stream to be\nsubject to TCP's other properties caused by TCP error control, which may be\ninappropriate for these applications.\n  The TCP decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of\napplying TCP congestion control to a data packet stream without actually\ntransporting the data packet stream on a TCP connection. Instead, a TCP\nconnection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up\nseparately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then\nassociated with that of the TCP packets. Since the transmission rate of these\nTCP packets is under TCP congestion control, so is that of the data packet\nstream. Furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a TCP\nconnection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to TCP error\ncontrol.\n  Because of this flexibility, the TCP decoupling approach opens up many new\nopportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some\nexisting applications. All of these advantages will be demonstrated in the\nthesis.\n  This thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the TCP\ndecoupling approach, and its successful applications in TCP trunking, wireless\ncommunication, and multimedia streaming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 1999 22:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
