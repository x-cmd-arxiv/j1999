Therefore we suggest that it will be\nnecessary to consider the rotation effects in the analyses of the coming binary\nevents if the microlensing events towards the halo are self-lensing. As an\nexample, we reexamine the MACHO LMC-9 event, in which the slow transverse\nvelocity of the lens binary suggests a microlensing event in the LMC disk. From\na simple analysis, it is shown that the lens binary with total mass $\\sim\n1M_{\\odot}$ rotates by more than $\\sim 60^{\\circ}$ during the Einstein radius\ncrossing time. However, the fitting of MACHO LMC-9 with an additional\nparameter, the rotation period, shows that the rotation effects are small,\ni.e., the projected rotation angle is only $\\sim 5.9^{\\circ}\n(M/M_{\\odot})^{1/4}$ during the Einstein radius crossing time. This\ncontradiction can be settled if the physical parameters, such as the mass and\nthe velocity, are different in this event, the binary is nearly edge-on, or the\nbinary is very eccentric, though definite conclusions cannot be drawn from this\nsingle event.

During the\nlater stages of the short-on state there are long intervals when the absorption\nis $\\approxgt$$5 \\times 10^{22}$ atom cm$^{-2}$. These intervals become longer\nand occur ~0.3 day earlier in each orbital cycle as the short-on state\nprogresses. During the intervals of high absorption the 0.1 keV blackbody is\nstill clearly detected. This may indicate the presence of separate scattered\nand absorbed spectral components, although other explanations such as partial\ncovering or a partially ionized absorber cannot be excluded. During the rest of\nthe short-on state the ratio of flux in the blackbody compared to the power-law\nis consistent with that in the main-on state. This supports the view that much\nof the 35 day modulation is caused by an energy independent process, such as\nelectron scattering. The discovery of strong absorption late in the short-on\nstate is consistent with the predictions of the warped disk model (Petterson\n1977, see also Schandl & Meyer 1994) where the end of the short-on state is\ncaused by the accretion disk moving into the line of sight to the neutron star.\nThe pulse phase difference between the blackbody and the power-law maxima is\n250 +/- 20 degrees in both observations (separated by 0.43 of a 35 day cycle).\nThis constant phase difference is consistent with the blackbody originating at\nthe inner edge of a precessing accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 1999 12:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The introduction of the equivalence being\nconsistent with the mathematical definition is possible only in theories\nconstructed on non-standard number spaces by taking the experimental errors as\ninfinitesimal numbers of the non-standard spaces. Following the idea for the\nequivalence (the physical equivalence), a new description of space-time in\nterms of infinitesimal-lattice points on non-standard real number space $\\SR$\nis proposed. The infinitesimal-lattice space, $^*{\\cal L}$, is represented by\nthe set of points on $\\SR$ which are written by $l_n=n\\SE$, where the\ninfinitesimal lattice-spacing $\\SE$ is determined by a non-standard natural\nnumber $^*N$ such that $\\SE\\equiv ^*N^{-1}$.
