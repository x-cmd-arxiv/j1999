The \"individual-statistical\" duality of the quasi-virialization\nprovides an explanation of the observed puzzle that the total masses of\nclusters derived from virial theorem are statistically the same as the\ngravitational lensing determined masses, in spite of the presence of irregular\nconfiguration and substructures in individual clusters.

The scenario takes advantage of the periodic third\ndredge-up episodes characterizing those stars, which mix primary C12 from their\nintershell layers to their surface. Two successive interpulse/pulse/dredge-up\nsequences are then required to produce Na23. During the first sequence carbon\nand oxygen are converted into N14 by the hydrogen burning shell, and\nsubsequently transformed into Ne22 by the helium burning shell. During the\nsecond sequence, Ne22 is converted into Na23 by the hydrogen burning shell,\nwhich is brought to the surface by the subsequent dredge-up episode. The Na23\nproduced by this scenario is thus primary.\n  The efficiency of this scenario is analyzed through standard evolutionary AGB\nmodel predictions combined with synthetic calculations for the surface chemical\nevolution.

Of particular interest is the class of embeddings which\nyield regular BPS black hole solutions carrying only R-R charge and whose\nmicroscopic description can possibly be given in terms of bound states of\nD-branes only. The microscopic interpretation of the bosonic fields in this\nclass of STU models relies on the solvable Lie algebra (SLA) method.

Hypernuclear states are treated in the\nsame manner as any other conventional nuclear excitation that emerges from the\nresponse of the nuclear ground state to an external probe. The nuclear response\nis calculated using a random-phase approximation to an effective relativistic\nmean-field model that reproduces bulk properties of normal nuclei. The relevant\nmeson-baryon vertices are constrained by imposing SU(3)-flavor symmetry, while\nthe residual hyperon-particle - nucleon-hole interaction is assumed to be\nmediated by the two lightest S = -1 mesons: the pseudoscalar kaon and its\nvector partner the K*(892). We use this model to analyze the spectra of oxygen\nand calcium hypernuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 1999 15:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
