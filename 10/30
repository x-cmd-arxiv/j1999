In this first paper, we\nconcentrate on the far-UV to near-IR continuum emission from the continuum\n``hot spot'' and surrounding regions extending out to +/- 6 arcsec (+/-432 pc)\nat a position angle of 202 degrees In addition to the broad emission lines\ndetected by spectropolarimetry, the hot spot shows the ``little blue bump'' in\nthe 2000 - 4000 Ang. range, which is due to Fe II and Balmer continuum\nemission. The continuum shape of the hot spot is indistinguishable from that of\nNGC 4151 and other Seyfert 1 galaxies. Thus, the hot spot is reflected emission\nfrom the hidden nucleus, due to electron scattering (as opposed to\nwavelength-dependent dust scattering). The hot spot is ~0.3 arcsec in extent\nand accounts for 20% of the scattered light in the inner 500 pc. We are able to\ndeconvolve the extended continuum emission in this region into two components:\nelectron-scattered light from the hidden nucleus (which dominates in the UV)\nand stellar light (which dominates in the optical and near-IR). The scattered\nlight is heavily concentrated towards the hot spot, is stronger in the\nnortheast, and is enhanced in regions of strong narrow-line emission. The\nstellar component is more extended, concentrated southwest of the hot spot,\ndominated by an old (> 2 x 10 Gyr) stellar population, and includes a nuclear\nstellar cluster which is ~200 pc in extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 1999 19:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
