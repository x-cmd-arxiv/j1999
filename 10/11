Their HI masses range between a few times\n10^8 and a few times 10^9 M_sun and the corresponding values for M_HI/L_B are\nbetween 0.07 and 0.42, so these systems are HI rich for their morphological\ntype. In all four galaxies, the HI is strongly centrally concentrated with high\ncentral HI surface densities, in contrast to what is typically observed in more\nluminous early-type galaxies. In two galaxies (NGC 802 and ESO 118-G34), the\nkinematics of the HI suggests that the gas is in a strongly warped disk, which\nwe take as evidence for recent accretion of HI.

The HI properties of low-luminosity early-type galaxies\nappear to be systematically different from those of many more luminous\nearly-type galaxies, and we suggest that these differences are due to a\ndifferent evolution of the two classes.

The Coulomb dissociation process which\nreverses the radiative capture by the dissociation of $^8$B in the Coulomb\nfield of a target, provides an alternate way of accessing this reaction. While\nthis method has several advantages (like large breakup cross sections and\nflexibility in the kinematics), the difficulties arise from the possible\ninterference by the nuclear interactions, uncertainties in the contributions of\nthe various multipoles and the higher order effects, which should be considered\ncarefully. We review the progress made so far in the experimental measurements\nand theoretical analysis of the breakup of $^8$B and discuss the current status\nof the low-energy cross sections (or the astrophysical $S$-factor) of the\n$^7$Be($p,\\gamma)^8$B reaction extracted therefrom.
