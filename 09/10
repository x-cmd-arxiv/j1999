An optimal mass-selection\nrequires a quantitative understanding of the noise behavior in mass maps. This\npaper is an analysis of the noise properties in mass maps reconstructed using a\nmaximum likelihood method. The noise power spectrum and the mass error bars are\nderived as a straightforward extension of the Kaiser & Squires (1993) algorithm\nto the case of a correlated noise. A very good agreement is found between these\ncalculations and the noise properties observed in maximum likelihood mass\nreconstructions limited to simulated non-critical clusters of galaxies. In a\nsecond part, I show that the statistic of peaks in the noise follows accurately\nthe peak statistics of a two-dimensional Gaussian random field (using the BBKS\ntechnics) if the smoothing aperture contains enough galaxies. This analysis\nprovides a procedure to derive the significance of any mass peak as a function\nof its amplitude and its profile. It is demonstrated that, to a very good\napproximation, a mass map is the sum of the lensing signal plus a 2D gaussian\nrandom noise, which means that a detailled quantitative analysis of the\nstructures in mass maps can be done. A direct application is the measurement of\nthe projected mass function in wide field lensing surveys, down to small mass\nhalos which are individually undetectable, this is the subject of a forthcoming\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 1999 18:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The light\nfrom the supernova explosion will scatter off this dust and produce a light\necho. Continuum emission seen after the peak will have contributions from both\nthis echo as well as from the shock of the ejecta colliding with the CSW, with\na fundamental question of which source dominates the continuum. We calculate\nthe brightness of the light echo as a function of time for a range of dust\nshell geometries, and use our calculations to fit to the light curves of SN\n1988Z and SN 1997ab, the two slowest declining IIn supernovae on record. We\nfind that the light curves of both objects can be reproduced by the echo model.\nHowever, their rate of decay from peak, color at peak and their observed peak\nabsolute magnitudes when considered together are inconsistent with the echo\nmodel. Furthermore, when the observed values of M$_{B}$ are corrected for the\neffects of dust scattering, the values obtained imply that these supernovae\nhave unrealistically high luminosities.

The Ly-alpha and rest-frame optical emission appear\nco-spatial with the brightest radio hotspot of this very asymmetric radio\nsource, suggesting extremely strong interaction with dense ambient clouds. The\nVLT observations are sufficiently sensitive to detect the continuum flux both\nblue-ward and red-ward of the Ly-alpha emission, allowing us to measure the\nLy-alpha forest continuum break (Ly-alpha 'discontinuity', D_A) and the Lyman\nlimit. We measure a D_A=0.37+-0.1, which is ~0.2 lower than the values found\nfor quasars at this redshift. We interpret this difference as possibly due to a\nbias towards large D_A introduced in high--redshift quasar samples that are\nselected on the basis of specific optical colors. If such a bias would exist in\noptically selected quasars, - and even in samples of Lyman break galaxies -,\nthen the space density of both classes of object will be underestimated.\nFurthermore, the average HI column density along cosmological lines of sight as\ndetermined using quasar absorption lines would be overestimated. Because of\ntheir radio-based selection, we argue that z>4 radio galaxies are excellent\nobjects for investigating D_A statistics.

In this review we summarize this development and\ndiscuss similarities and differences of the appearence of the pseudogap phase\nin superconductors and the Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio - like models. We\ndiscuss its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and color\nsuperconductors. This paper is organized in three parts: in the first section\nwe briefly review the separation of temperatures of pair formation and pair\ncondensation in strong - coupling and low carrier density superconductors (i.e.\nthe formation of the {\\it pseudogap phase}).\n  Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an analogous\nphenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N. In the third section we\ndiscuss the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model where the chiral phase transition\nis accompanied by a formation of a phase analogous to the pseudogap phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 1999 22:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2000 22:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2000 16:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 19:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
