This transition has two main\nsignatures: the random localization of a fraction of the monomers and the\nemergence of a nonzero static shear modulus. In this article, a\nsemi-microscopic statistical mechanical theory of the elastic properties of the\namorphous solid state is developed. This theory takes into account both\nquenched disorder and thermal fluctuations, and allows for the direct\ncomputation of the free energy change of the sample due to a given macroscopic\nshear strain. This leads to an unambiguous determination of the static shear\nmodulus. At the level of mean field theory, it is found (i) that the shear\nmodulus grows continuously from zero at the transition, and does so with the\nclassical exponent, i.e., with the third power of the excess crosslink density\nand, quite surprisingly, (ii) that near the transition the external stresses do\nnot spoil the spherical symmetry of the localization clouds of the particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 1999 17:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
