If the cosmological constant is\npositive, it eventually dominates the universe and bubbles of inflationary\nphase begin to nucleate at a constant rate. Thermalized regions inside these\ninflating bubbles will give rise to new galaxies and civilizations. It is\npossible in principle to send a message to one of them. It might even be\npossible to send a device whose purpose is to recreate an approximation of the\noriginal civilization in the new region. However, the message or device will\nalmost certainly be intercepted by black holes, which nucleate at a much higher\nrate than inflating bubbles. Formation of new inflating regions can also be\ntriggered by gravitational collapse, but again the probability is low, and the\nnumber of attempts required for a positive outcome is enormous. The probability\ncan be higher if the energy scale of inflation is closer to the Planck scale,\nbut a high energy scale produces a tight bound on the amount of information\nthat can be transmitted. One can try to avoid quantum tunneling altogether, but\nthis requires a violation of quantum inequalities which constrain the magnitude\nof negative energy densities. However, the limits of validity of quantum\ninequalities are not clear, and future research may show that the required\nviolation is in fact possible.

A new mechanism for destruction of coherence by\nnoise is analyzed using both heuristic and formal approach. Its effectiveness\nconstitutes a manifestation of long-range non-trivial dynamical correlations.\nPerturbation theory fails to quantify certain aspects of this effect. In the\nperturbative case, for sufficiently weak noise, the diffusion coefficient\n${\\cal D}$ is just proportional to the noise intensity $\\nu$. It is predicted\nthat in some generic cases one may have a non-perturbative dependence ${\\cal\nD}\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$ with $0.35 < \\alpha < 0.38$ for arbitrarily weak noise.\nThis work has been found relevant to the recently studied ionization of H-atoms\nby a microwave electric field in the presence of noise.
