We have used the Hubble Space Telescope\nto obtain a far-UV/optical color-magnitude diagram of three fields in omega\nCen. We find that over 30% of the HB objects are ``extreme'' HB or hot post-HB\nstars. The hot HB stars are not concentrated toward the cluster center, which\nargues against a dynamical origin for them. A wide gap in the color\ndistribution of the hot HB stars appears to correspond to gaps found earlier in\nseveral other clusters. This suggests a common mechanism, probably related to\ngiant branch mass loss. The diagram contains a significant population of hot\nsub-HB stars, which we interpret as the ``blue-hook'' objects predicted by\nD'Cruz et al. (1996a). These are produced by late He-flashes in stars which\nhave undergone unusually large giant branch mass loss. omega Cen has a\nwell-known spread of metal abundance, and our observations are consistent with\na giant branch mass loss efficiency which increases with metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 1999 09:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One approach is to extrapolate\npresent-day technologies by orders of magnitude; the other is to find new\nregimes in physics and to search for possible new laws of physics. Recent work\non the zero-point field (ZPF), or electromagnetic quantum vacuum, is promising\nin regard to the latter, especially concerning the possibility that the inertia\nof matter may, at least in part, be attributed to interaction between the\nquarks and electrons in matter and the ZPF. A NASA-funded study (independent of\nthe BPP program) of this concept has been underway since 1996 at the Lockheed\nMartin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto and the California State\nUniversity at Long Beach. We report on a new development resulting from this\neffort: that for the specific case of the electron, a resonance for the\ninertia-generating process at the Compton frequency would simultaneously\nexplain both the inertial mass of the electron and the de Broglie wavelength of\na moving electron as first measured by Davisson and Germer in 1927.
