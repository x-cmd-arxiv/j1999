Even if the potential is assumed to be smooth,\nhowever, orbits in non-axisymmetric galaxies can be chaotic due to the presence\nof central density cusps or black holes. The chaotic nature of orbits implies\nthat perturbations will grow exponentially and this in turn is expected to\nresult in a diffusion in phase space. We show that the degree of orbital\nevolution is not well predicted by the growth rate of infinitesimal\nperturbations, i.e. by the Liapunov exponent. A more useful criterion is\nwhether perturbations continue to grow exponentially until their scale is of\norder the size of the system. We illustrate these ideas in a potential\nconsisting of N fixed point masses. Liapunov exponents are large for all values\nof N, but orbits become increasingly regular in their behavior as N increases;\nthe reason is that the exponential divergence saturates at smaller and smaller\ndistances as N is increased. The objects which impede diffusion are the\ninvariant tori. When there are few stable tori, an ensemble of chaotic orbits\nevolves rapidly toward a nearly stationary state. This mixing process occurs on\ntimescales of a few crossing times in triaxial potentials containing massive\ncentral singularities, consistent with the rapid evolution observed in N-body\nsimulations of galaxies with central black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 1999 17:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

The\nhelium-burning shell which forms in this region is too thick to be unstable,\nand gravonuclear instabilities do not occur.

The helium shell which\nforms just exterior to this discontinuity is then much thinner and can be\nthermally unstable. Even in this case, however, the gravonuclear instabilities\ndisappear as soon as the nuclear burning broadens the helium shell into its\ncharacteristic S-shape.

Detailed comparisons with various theoretical\nscenarios using models computed with the evolutionary code FRANEC have been\ndone reaching the following conclusions: both standard models (i.e. computed by\nadopting the Schwarzschild criterion to fix the border of the convective core)\nand models with an enlarged convective core (overshooting) lead to a fair fit\nof the MS but are not able to reproduce the luminosity and/or the number of He\nburning giants. Models including a fraction of 30% of binaries leads to a good\nfit both to the MS luminosity function and to the He clump, if standards models\nare considered, for a visual distance modulus (m-M)v = 18.8, age t ~ 100 Myr\nand mass function slope alpha ~ 2.4, thus largely removing the \"classical\"\ndiscrepancy between observed and predicted number of stars in the He burning\nclump.

Recent astrophysical\nobservations provide us with very precise values of the relevant cosmological\nparameters. Certain of these parameters have direct implications on particle\nphysics, e.g., the value of matter density, which in conjunction with\nelectroweak precision data put severe constraints on the supersymmetry breaking\nscale. In the context of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(CMSSM) such limits read as: $M_{1/2} \\simeq 300 \\GeV - 340 \\GeV$, $m_0 \\simeq\n80 \\GeV - 130 \\GeV$. Within the context of the CMSSM a way to avoid these\nconstraints is either to go to the large $\\tan \\beta$ and $\\mu > 0$ region, or\nmake ${\\tilde \\tau}_R$, the next to lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), be\nalmost degenerate in mass with LSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 1999 23:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2000 22:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Because of not completeness of the literature under the hand, we are\nnot sure that this simple phenomenon isn't known in quantum theory of\natom-photon interactions or, particularly, in the interferometry of atomic\nmatter waves.
