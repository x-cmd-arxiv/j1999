For this, we consider fluctuations\nin the graviton, gravitino and 3-form around the flat background, which couple\nto the boundary $E_8$ gauge-supermultiplet. They give rise to exchange\namplitudes or forces between both boundary fixed-planes. In leading order of\nthe D=11 gravitational coupling constant $\\kappa$, we find an expected trivial\nvanishing of all three amplitudes and thereby stability of the flat vacuum in\nthe static limit, in which the centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ of the\ngauge-multiplet fields is zero. For $\\sqrt{s}>0$, however, which could be\nregarded a vacuum state with excitations on the boundary, the amplitudes\nneither vanish nor cancel each other, thus leading to an attractive force\nbetween the fixed-planes in the flat vacuum. A ground state showing stability\nwith regard to boundary excitations, is therefore expected to exhibit a\nnon-trivial metric. Ten-dimensional Lorentz-invariance requires a warped\ngeometry.
