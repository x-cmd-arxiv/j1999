Rapid X-ray variability is detected with a factor of two\nchange in count rate within one day and 20% variability within about three\nhours, which practically rules out any significant contribution of scattered\nX-rays. We present for the first time a detailed, self-consistent modeling of\nthe ROSAT PSPC and ASCA spectrum of IRAS13349+2438 in terms of a warm absorber\nincluding dust.

The evolution is quasi-stationary until a merging process\nstarts, since the time scale of the orbital change due to gravitational wave\nemission is longer than the orbital period. In this stage, equilibrium\nsequences can be applied to evolution of compact binary star systems. Along the\nequilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some\ninstability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed\nrelations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the\nmass overflow as well as the dynamical instability of orbital motions.\nConcerning the equilibrium sequences of binary star systems, we have summarized\nclassical results of incompressible ellipsoidal configurations. Recent results\nof compressible binary star systems obtained by the ellipsoidal approximation\nand by numerical computations have been shown and discussed.
