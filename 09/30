This results from the cool sources\nhaving more massive envelopes rather than warm sources having larger disks.\nAzimuthally-averaged radial profiles of the dust emission are used to derive\nthe power-law index of the envelope density distributions, p (defined by rho\nproportional to r^-p), and most of the sources are found to have values of p\nconsistent with those predicted by models of cloud collapse.

We find that there is evidence of two modes of star\nformation, in bursts and continuously. The equivalent width of the CaII triplet\nabsorption lines show that, in the metal rich central region, the continuum is\ndominated by a population of red supergiants. The gaseous and stellar\nkinematics along three slit position angles, suggest the existence of a\nhierarchy of disks within disks, whose dynamics are decoupled at the two ILRs,\nthat we find at 180 pc and at 1100 pc.

Most of the observed molecular\nemission can be explained by a single emission region at T~300-900 K and\nn(H_2)~10^(5-6) cm^(-3),with a diameter of about 2-3 arcsec. This corresponds\nto a very compact region of 300-400 AU at the distance of 140 pc. An higher\ntemperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation CO\nand water lines.

As a result we obtain a class\nof equivalent Lagrangians, generating identical S-matrix elements, of which the\noriginal Lagrangian is but one representative. We make use of this property in\norder to show that what appears as an off-shell effect in an S-matrix element\nfor one Lagrangian may originate in a contact term from an equivalent\nLagrangian. By explicit calculation we demonstrate for the case of\nnucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung as well as nucleon Compton scattering the\nequivalence of observables from which we conclude that off-shell effects cannot\nin any unambiguous way be extracted from an S-matrix element. Finally, we also\ndiscuss some implications of introducing off-shell effects on a\nphenomenological basis, resulting from the requirement that the description of\none process be consistent with that of other processes described by the same\nLagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 1999 01:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
