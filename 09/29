Remarkable variations are seen in the absorption\nband profile in the different lines of sight. The main feature is attributed to\n13CO2 mixed with polar molecules such as H2O, and CH3OH. Several high-mass\nprotostars show an additional narrow substructure at 4.382 um, which we\nattribute to a polar CO2 ice, that experienced heating.

Nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations are employed using three\nindependent numerical codes.\n  A principal result is that the direction of the orbital migration is always\ninwards and such that the protoplanet reaches the central star in a near\ncircular orbit after a characteristic viscous time scale of approximately\n10,000 initial orbital periods. This was found to be independent of whether the\nprotoplanet was allowed to accrete mass or not. Inward migration is helped\nthrough the disappearance of the inner disc, and therefore the positive torque\nit would exert, because of accretion onto the central star.Our results indicate\nthat a realistic upper limit for the masses of closely orbiting giant planets\nis approximately 5 Jupiter masses, because of the reduced accretion rates\nobtained for planets of increasing mass.\n  Assuming some process such as termination of the inner disc through a\nmagnetospheric cavity stops the migration, the range of masses estimated for a\nnumber of close orbiting giant planets (Marcy, Cochran, & Mayor 1999; Marcy &\nButler 1998) as well as their inward orbital migration can be accounted for by\nconsideration of disc--protoplanet interactions during the late stages of giant\nplanet formation. Maximally accreting protoplanets reached about four Jovian\nmasses on reaching the neighbourhood of the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 1999 12:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The physical\nparameters of the flaring region have been derived by analyzing the decay,\nusing both a quasi-static approach and an approach based on hydrodynamic\nsimulations of decaying flaring loops.

I discuss physical motivations and possible consistent realizations\nof large volume compactifications and low string scale. Large longitudinal\ndimensions, seen by Standard Model particles, imply in general that string\ntheory is strongly coupled unless its tension is close to the compactification\nscale. Weakly coupled, low-scale strings can in turn be realized only in the\npresence of extra large transverse dimensions, seen through gravitational\ninteractions, or in the presence of infinitesimal string coupling. In the\nformer case, quantum gravity scale is also low, while in the latter,\ngravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensional\nPlanck mass. There is one exception in this general rule, allowing for large\nlongitudinal dimensions without low string scale, when Standard Model is\nembedded in a six-dimensional fixed-point theory described by a tensionless\nstring. Extra dimensions of size as large as TeV$^{-1}\\simeq 10^{-16}$ cm are\nmotivated from the problem of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, while\nTeV scale strings offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as an\nalternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor.
