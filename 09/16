The conversion of the limiting flux of a survey into the\ncorresponding minimum mass of the hosting DM haloes is obtained by using\ntheoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and X-ray\nluminosity of clusters. Finally, our model is calibrated to reproduce the\nobserved cluster counts adopting a temperature-luminosity relation moderately\nevolving with redshift.

We consider the\ngradient component of the polarization from density perturbations (scalar\nmodes) and the curl component from gravitational waves (tensor modes). We show\nthat the amplitude (and thus the detectability) of the polarization from\ndensity perturbations is roughly the same in any model as long as the model\nfits the big-bang-nucleosynthesis (BBN) baryon density and degree-scale\nanisotropy measurements. The degree-scale polarization is smaller (and\naccordingly more difficult to detect) if the baryon density is higher. In some\ncases, the signal-to-noise for polarization (both from scalar and tensor modes)\nmay be improved in a fixed-time experiment with a smaller survey area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 1999 23:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We show that\nfor two or more dimensions, the problem of predicting the cluster from a given\nset of paths is complete for the complexity class CC, the subset of P\ncharacterized by circuits composed of comparator gates. CC-completeness is\nbelieved to imply that, in the worst case, growing a cluster of size n requires\npolynomial time in n even on a parallel computer.\n  A parallel relaxation algorithm is presented that uses the fact that clusters\nare nearly spherical to guess the cluster from a given set of paths, and then\ncorrects defects in the guessed cluster through a non-local annihilation\nprocess. The parallel running time of the relaxation algorithm for\ntwo-dimensional internal DLA is studied by simulating it on a serial computer.\nThe numerical results are compatible with a running time that is either\npolylogarithmic in n or a small power of n. Thus the computational resources\nneeded to grow large clusters are significantly less on average than the\nworst-case analysis would suggest.\n  For a parallel machine with k processors, we show that random clusters in d\ndimensions can be generated in O((n/k + log k) n^{2/d}) steps. This is a\nsignificant speedup over explicit sequential simulation, which takes\nO(n^{1+2/d}) time on average.\n  Finally, we show that in one dimension internal DLA can be predicted in O(log\nn) parallel time, and so is in the complexity class NC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 1999 20:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that the discrete asymptotic nets are\nrepresented by isotropic congruences in the Plucker quadric. On the basis of\nthe Lelieuvre-type representation of asymptotic lattices and of the discrete\nanalog of the Moutard transformation, it is constructed the discrete analog of\nthe W-congruences, which provide the Darboux-Backlund type transformation of\nasymptotic lattices.The permutability theorems for the discrete Moutard\ntransformation and for the corresponding transformation of asymptotic lattices\nare established as well. Moreover, it is proven that the discrete W-congruences\nare represented by quadrilateral lattices in the quadric of Plucker. These\nresults generalize to a discrete level the classical line-geometric approach to\nasymptotic nets and W-congruences, and incorporate the theory of asymptotic\nlattices into more general theory of quadrilateral lattices and their\nreductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 1999 15:46:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2000 19:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
