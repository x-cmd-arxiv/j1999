An important consequence of these models is that\nsignificant quantities of dust are required in order to provide the obscuring\nmedium, which will be heated by the nuclear radiation from the AGN, and will\nradiate in the thermal infra-red. We therefore model the properties of the\ndust, and predict the contribution of obscured AGN to the intensity of the far\ninfra-red background and the sub-mm source counts and redshift distribution, in\norder to ascertain whether our models are constrained further by the data\navailable at these wavelengths. Our conservative models predict a contribution\nof between 5 and 15 per cent of the far infra-red background intensity, whereas\nif we use more extreme values for several parameters, this value may reach 33\nper cent. This suggests that AGN may only form a significant minority of sub-mm\nsources, in agreement with the results of spectroscopic follow-up. Our models\nthus show that there is no inconsistency between obscured AGN models for the\nX-ray background and either sub-mm source counts or the intensity of the far\ninfra-red background. We further propose that obscured AGN may explain the\nsub-mm emission associated with Extremely Red Objects (EROs). Finally, we make\npredictions for the redshift distribution of AGN sources detected in faint\nsub-mm surveys, which should allow future tests of this obscured AGN model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 1999 17:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We calculate the time evolution of the linear susceptibility for\nthe probe laser field and show that, depending on the strength of the coupling\nto the modified vacuum and the background decay, the probe transmission can\nexhibit behaviour ranging from underdamped to overdamped oscillations.\nTransient gain without population inversion is also possible depending on the\nsystem's parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 1999 18:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2000 15:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
