The interaction of a high-powered jet with a dense cloud in the halo of\n4C41.17 produces shock-excited emission-line nebulosity through ~1000 km/s\nshocks and induces star formation. The CIII to CIV line ratio and the CIV\nluminosity emanating from the shock, imply that the pre-shock density in the\nline-emitting cloud is high enough (~1-10 cm^-3) that shock initiated star\nformation could proceed on a timescale of order a few x 10^6 yrs, well within\nthe estimated dynamical age of the radio source.

We have\nnumerically investigated whether grey dust can be emitted from high redshift\ngalaxies without also emitting standard, reddening dust, which would have been\nvisible in the spectra of high redshift objects. Our finding is that grain\nvelocities are almost independent of ellipticity so that if greyness are due to\nthe grains being elongated, it will not be possible to separate grey dust from\nordinary dust. We also find that velocities are fairly independent of grain\nsize, but we cannot rule out possible sputtering of small grains, so that\nlarge, grey dust grains could be preferentially emitted. Therefore, our\nconclusion is that grey dust is an unlikely explanation of the data, but we\ncannot rule it out if the grey dust consists of large, spherical grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 1999 08:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that for three generations each of doublet and singlet\nneutrinos, diagonalization of the Hamiltonian to obtain the propagating\neigenstates in the general case requires diagonalization of a $12\\times12$\nHermitian matrix, rather than the traditional $6\\times6$ symmetric mass matrix.\nThe symmetries of the $12\\times12$ matrix {\\em are} such that it has 6 pairs of\nreal eigenvalues. Although the standard \"see-saw\" mechanism remains valid, and\nindeed the eigenvalues obtained are identical to the standard ones, the correct\ndescription of diagonalization and mixing is more complicated.

These are chosen to have a periodical\nstructure with the same period, such that a Floquet matrix describes the time\nevolution of the quantum states. We show that, if the states are unstable, the\neigenvalues of the Floquet matrix may have contributions proportional to the\nsquare root of the parity violating interaction matrix element $H_w$ while they\nare almost degenerate in their parity even part. This leads to beat frequencies\nproportional to $\\sqrt{H_w}$ which are expected to be larger by several orders\nof magnitude compared to ordinary P-violating contributions which are of order\n$H_w$.
