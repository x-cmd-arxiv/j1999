We\nshow that, if this is indeed the case, GRBs and their afterglows provide a\npowerful probe of the very high redshift (VHR) (z > 5) universe. We first\nestablish that GRBs and their afterglows are both detectable out to VHRs. We\nthen show that one expects GRBs to occur out to at least z ~ 10 and possibly z\n\\~ 15 - 20, redshifts that are far larger than those expected for the most\ndistant quasars. This implies that there are large numbers of GRBs with peak\nphoton number fluxes below the detection thresholds of BATSE and HETE-2, and\neven below the detection threshold of Swift. The mere detection of VHR GRBs\nwould give us our first information about the earliest generations of stars. We\nshow that GRBs and their afterglows can be used as beacons to locate core\ncollapse SNe at redshifts z >> 1, and to study the properties of these SNe. We\ndescribe the expected properties of the absorption-line systems and the\nLy-alpha forest in the spectra of GRB afterglows, and discuss various\nstrategies for determining the redshifts of VHR GRBs. We then show how the\nabsorption-line systems and the Ly-alpha forest visible in the spectra of GRB\nafterglows can be used to trace the evolution of metallicity in the universe,\nand to probe the large-scale structure of the universe at VHRs. Finally, we\nshow how measurement of the Ly-alpha break in the spectra of GRB afterglows can\nbe used to constrain, or possibly measure, the epoch at which re-ionization of\nthe universe occurred, using the Gunn-Peterson test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 1999 22:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2000 22:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The GRB ejecta are ultra-relativistic, and possibly\nbeamed. There is a possibility that some SN ejecta are also beamed and/or\nrelativistic. Prospects for farther advances guided by expected and unexpected\nobservational developments are very good. The prospects for developing a sound\nand quantitative GRB theory any time soon are rather modest, if histories of\nquasars, radio pulsars and supernovae are used for reference. However, the\ncurrent progress in the understanding of GRB afterglows (which are\nrelativistic) and remnants (which are non-relativistic) is likely to continue,\nas these appear to be simpler than the GRBs.\n  According to the current analysis of GRB 970508 the energy of gamma rays\nreleased by this event was about the same as the total energy of explosion. If\ncorrect, this result is difficult to reconcile with the internal shock models.\nIt also implies that the global energy generation rate by GRBs is four orders\nof magnitude lower than the rate due to ordinary supernovae, which makes it\nvery unlikely that the highly energetic supernova remnants were created by\nGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1999 13:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 1999 19:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2001 20:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is a special case of\nthe random average process of Ferrari and Fontes [El. J. Prob. 3, Paper no. 6\n(1998)].

Roughly put, the SYZ conjecture suggests that\nmirror pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds are related by the existence of dual\nspecial Lagrangian torus fibrations. We explore this conjecture without\nreference to the special Lagrangian condition. In this setting, natural\nquestions include: does there exist a nice class of T^3-fibrations for which\nthe dual fibration can be constructed? Do such fibrations exist on a manifold\nsuch as the quintic threefold? If so, is the dual fibration the mirror?\n  We answer these questions affirmatively. We introduce a class of topological\nT^3-fibrations for which duals can be constructed, including over the singular\nfibres. We then construct such a fibration on the quintic threefold, and show\nthat by applying this general dualizing construction to this particular case,\none obtains the mirror quintic. Thus we have constructed the mirror quintic\ntopologically with no a priori knowledge of the mirror. This shows that in a\nnon-degenerate (and representative) case, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture\ncorrectly explains mirror symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1999 15:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 1999 13:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
