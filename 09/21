Several regimes are\nidentified in the Rayleigh number versus Prandtl number phase space, defined by\nwhether the boundary layer or the bulk dominates the global kinetic and thermal\ndissipation, respectively. The crossover between the regimes is calculated. In\nthe regime which has most frequently been studied in experiment (Ra smaller\nthan 10^{11}) the leading terms are $Nu\\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{1/8}$, $Re \\sim\nRa^{1/2} Pr^{-3/4}$ for $Pr < 1$ and $Nu\\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{-1/12}$, $Re \\sim\nRa^{1/2} Pr^{-5/6}$ for $Pr > 1$. In most measurements these laws are modified\nby additive corrections from the neighboring regimes so that the impression of\na slightly larger (effective) Nu vs Ra scaling exponent can arise. -- The\npresented theory is best summarized in the phase diagram figure 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 1999 14:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

Duan et al remark that their criterion is based on a \"much\nstronger bound\" on the total variance of a pair of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type\noperators than is required simply by the uncertainty relation. Here, we seek to\nformalize and test this particular assertion in both classical and\nquantum-theoretic frameworks. We first attach to these states the classical a\npriori probability (Jeffreys' prior), proportional to the volume element of the\nFisher information metric on the Riemannian manifold of Gaussian (quadrivariate\nnormal) probability distributions. Then, numerical evidence indicates that more\nthan ninety-nine percent of the Gaussian two-party states do, in fact, meet the\nmore stringent criterion for separability. We collaterally note that the prior\nprobability assigned to the classical states, that is those having positive\nGlauber-Sudarshan P-representations, is less than one-thousandth of one\npercent. We, then, seek to attach as a measure to the Gaussian two-party\nstates, the volume element of the associated (quantum-theoretic) Bures (minimal\nmonotone) metric. Our several extensive analyses, then, persistently yield\nprobabilities of separability and classicality that are, to very high orders of\naccuracy, unity and zero, respectively, so the two apparently quite distinct\n(classical and quantum-theoretic) forms of analysis are rather remarkably\nconsistent in their findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 1999 22:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 1999 18:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 1999 19:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2000 22:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
