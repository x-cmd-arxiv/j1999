This is particularly noticeable when luminosity\nfunctions are produced for a number of different redshift ranges as is common\nin the study of AGN or galaxy evolution. We present a simple method of\nconstructing a binned luminosity function which overcomes this problem and has\na number of other advantages over the traditional 1/Va method. We also describe\na practical method for comparing binned and model luminosity functions, by\ncalculating the expectation values of the binned luminosity function from the\nmodel. Binned luminosity functions produced by the two methods are compared for\nsimulated data and for the Large Bright QSO Survey (LBQS). It is shown that the\n1/Va method produces a very misleading picture of evolution in the LBQS. The\nbinned luminosity function of the LBQS is then compared to a model two power\nlaw luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution from Boyle et al.\n(1991). The comparison is made using a model luminosity function averaged over\neach redshift shell, and using the expectation values for the binned luminosity\nfunction calculated from the model. The luminosity function averaged in each\nredshift shell gives a misleading impression that the model over predicts the\nnumber of QSOs at low luminosity even when model and data are consistent. The\nexpectation values show that there are significant differences between model\nand data: the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources at both\nlow and high redshift. The luminosity function does not appear to steepen\nrelative to the model as redshift increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 1999 11:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}
