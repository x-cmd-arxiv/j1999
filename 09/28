The\npolarization position angles are practically constant with wavelength and are\nconsistent with those of neighboring stars. Thus the simplest conclusion is\nthat the polarization of all the program stars is primarily interstellar.\n  The O stars chosen for this study are generally known from ultraviolet and\noptical spectroscopy to have substantial mass loss rates and variable winds, as\nwell as occasional circumstellar emission. Their lack of intrinsic polarization\nin comparison with the similar Be stars may be explained by the dominance of\nradiation as a wind driving force due to higher luminosity, which results in\nlower density and less rotational flattening in the electron scattering inner\nenvelopes where the polarization is produced.

Here I investigate the relationship between global X-ray\nemission and shape of the inner surface brightness profile, for a sample of 59\nearly type galaxies. I find a clear dicothomy also in the X-ray properties, in\nthe sense that core galaxies span the whole observed range of Lx values, while\npower law galaxies are confined below log Lx (erg/s)=41. Moreover, the relation\nbetween Lx and the shape of the central profile is the strongest among the\nrelations of Lx with the basic properties characterizing the two families of\nearly type galaxies. So, a global property such as Lx, that measures the hot\ngas content on a galactic scale, turns out to be surprisingly well linked to a\nnuclear property. Various possible reasons are explored for the origin of the\ndifferent Lx behavior of core and power law galaxies. While a few explanations\ncan be imagined for the large spread in the X-ray luminosities of core\ngalaxies, an open problem is why power law ones never become very X-ray bright.\nIt is likely that the presence of a central massive black hole, and possibly\nalso the environment, play an important role in determining Lx.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 1999 13:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study how these\nresults are affected by degeneracy of energy levels. In addition to the\ntime-reversal symmetry, for certain energy spectra and more generally for\nlattice symmetries, energy levels are strongly degenerate near the Fermi\nenergy. For a parabolic dispersion, degeneracy d is of the order of k_FL while\nthe typical distance between the levels is of the order of epsilon_F/(k_FL)^2\nwhere k_F and epsilon_F are the Fermi wave vector and energy, respectively, and\nL is the particle size.
