The bulk Lorentz factor of the plasma, Gamma, derived as a\nfunction of distance from the radiating source, is compared with the\ncorresponding result in the Thomson limit. Depending on the geometry and\nspectrum of the radiation field, we find that particles are accelerated to the\nasymptotic Lorentz factor at infinity much more rapidly in the relativistic\nregime; and the radiation drag is reduced as blueshifted, aberrated photons\nexperience a decreased relativistic cross section and scatter preferentially in\nthe forward direction.

The\nsimulations have been performed for a broad range, of ICM temperatures (kT =\n1,4 and 8 keV), representative of poor clusters or groups through to rich\nclusters. There are several dynamical features that can be identified in these\nsimulations; for supersonic galaxy motion, a leading bow-shock is present, and\nalso a weak gravitationally focussed wake or tail behind the galaxy (analogous\nto Bondi-Hoyle accretion). For galaxies with higher mass-replenishment rates\nand a denser interstellar medium (ISM), the dominant feature is a dense\nram-pressure stripped tail.

To this\nend, it is often assumed, that in order to obtain more reliable estimates, one\nshould include the sizable one--loop Standard Model (SM) corrections, which\nmodify the $Z^0$ couplings as well as other observables. This conviction is\nbased on the belief that the higher order contributions from the ``extension\nsector'' will be numerically small. However, the structure of higher order\ncorrections can be quite different when comparing the SM with its extension,\nthus one should avoid assumptions which do not care about such facts.

In particular, this works for sheaves on a ringed\nspace, and for quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact, quasi-separated\nscheme. However, this injective model structure is not well suited to studying\nthe derived tensor product, so we investigate other model structures. The most\nsuccessful of these is the flat model structure on complexes of sheaves over a\nringed space. This is based on flat resolutions, and is compatible with the\ntensor product. As a corollary, we get model categories of differential graded\nalgebras of sheaves and differential graded modules over a given differential\ngraded algebra of sheaves.\n  This is the author's first attempt to understand sheaves, so comments from\nthose more experienced with the subject are welcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 1999 10:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
