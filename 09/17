Only gas with densities above the\ncritical density given by Toomre's stability criterion is considered eligible\nfor star formation, and a simple recipe for supernovae feedback is included. We\nemphasize the importance of extracting the proper luminosity and velocity\nmeasures from the models, something that has often been ignored in the past.\nThe observed K-band TF relation has a slope that is steeper than simple\npredictions based on dynamical arguments suggest. Taking the stability related\nstar formation threshold densities into account steepens the TF relation,\ndecreases its scatter, and yields gas mass fractions that are in excellent\nagreement with observations. In order for the TF slope to be as steep as\nobserved, further physics are required. We argue that the characteristics of\nthe observed near-infrared TF relation do not reflect systematic variations in\nstellar populations, or cosmological initial conditions, but are governed by\nfeedback. Finally we show that our models provide a natural explanation for the\nsmall amount of scatter that makes the TF relation useful as a cosmological\ndistance indicator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 1999 23:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The shells responsible for\nthese shocks merge together and undergo an external shock at about 10^{17} cm,\nproducing the afterglows. We include deceleration in our model of internal\nshocks and find that, for values of the Lorentz factor greater than 10^3,\ndeceleration is an effective catalyst for converting the bulk motion energy\ninto radiation during the GRB phase. Substantial internal energy occurs because\nother shells run into the back of the first shell which has decelerated and\nbecause the first shell must energize the interstellar medium. Whereas internal\nshocks without deceleration are about 25% efficient, we can convert up to 85%\nof the bulk motion energy during the GRB phase. We demonstrate that the\nresulting time history can have three components. The first is due to internal\nshocks, excluding those that involve the first shell. This component produces\nnarrow peaks throughout the time history. The second is due to internal shocks\ninvolving the first shell, and it produces progressively wider and wider peaks\nbut they tend to be hidden in a slowly varying background in the event. The\nthird component is from energizing the interstellar medium. It is very smooth\nand may contribute mostly to a lower energy bandpass than the BATSE experiment.\nThere have been claims of upper limits on the possible Lorentz factor because\nthe deceleration must occur at greater radii than the internal shocks to avoid\nmaking progressively wider peaks. We do not find this to be the case, and the\nLorentz factor (and efficiency) can be much larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 1999 01:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The thickness of the layers is\nproportional to the input flow of particles $r_0$ and coincides with the\nthickness of stratified layers in a two-component sandpile problem which were\nobserved recently. We find that the surface angle $\\theta$ of the pile reaches\nits final critical value ($\\theta_f$) only at long times after a complicated\nrelaxation process. The deviation ($\\theta_f - \\theta $) behaves asymptotically\nas $(t/r_{0})^{-1/2}$. It appears that the pile evolution depends on initial\nconditions. We consider two cases: (i) grains are absent at the initial moment,\nand (ii) there is already a pile with a critical slope initially. Although at\nlong times the behavior appears to be similar in both cases, some differences\nare observed for the different initial conditions are observed.

This is done by analyzing numerically a system of eight Ising\nmodels (corresponding to c=4) coupled to dynamically triangulated Lorentzian\ngeometries. It is known that a single Ising model couples weakly to Lorentzian\nquantum gravity, in the sense that the Hausdorff dimension of the ensemble of\ntwo-geometries is two (as in pure Lorentzian quantum gravity) and the matter\nbehaviour is governed by the Onsager exponents. By increasing the amount of\nmatter to 8 Ising models, we find that the geometry of the combined system has\nundergone a phase transition. The new phase is characterized by an anomalous\nscaling of spatial length relative to proper time at large distances, and as a\nconsequence the Hausdorff dimension is now three. In spite of this qualitative\nchange in the geometric sector, and a very strong interaction between matter\nand geometry, the critical exponents of the Ising model retain their Onsager\nvalues. This provides evidence for the conjecture that the KPZ values of the\ncritical exponents in 2d Euclidean quantum gravity are entirely due to the\npresence of baby universes.
