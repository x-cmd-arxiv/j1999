In the direction parallel to the magnetic fields, the magnetic\ntension completely suppresses the convection. If the adiabatic index $\\gamma$\nis less than a certain critical value, the perturbations trigger the Parker as\nwell as the Jeans instability in the disk. Consequently, the growth rate curve\nhas two maxima: one at small wavenumber due to a combination of the Parker and\nJeans instabilities, and the other at somewhat larger wavenumber mostly due to\nthe Parker instability.

Since many observations of galaxy\nclustering will be done at high redshift, the time evolution of non-linear\nstochastic biasing would play a crucial role for the data analysis of the\nfuture sky surveys. In this paper, we develop the weakly non-linear analysis\nand attempt to clarify the non-linear feature of the stochastic biasing. We\ncompute the one-loop correction of the power spectrum for the total mass, the\ngalaxies and their cross correlation. Assuming the local functional form for\nthe initial galaxy distribution, we investigate the time evolution of the\nbiasing parameter and the correlation coefficient. On large scales, we first\nfind that the time evolution of the biasing parameter could deviate from the\nlinear prediction in presence of the initial skewness. However, the deviation\ncan be reduced when the initial stochasticity exists. Next, we focus on the\nquasi-linear scales, where the non-linear growth of the total mass becomes\nimportant. It is recognized that the scale-dependence of the biasing\ndynamically appears and the initial stochasticity could affect the time\nevolution of the scale-dependence. The result is compared with the recent\nN-body simulation that the scale-dependence of the halo biasing can appear on\nrelatively large scales and the biasing parameter takes the lower value on\nsmaller scales. Qualitatively, our weakly non-linear results can explain this\ntrend if the halo-mass biasing relation has the large scatter at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 1999 15:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Results for the `normal' (r = 0) impurity model are obtained as a\nspecific case. Particular emphasis is given both to single-particle excitation\ndynamics, and to the transition between the strong coupling (SC) and local\nmoment (LM) phases of the model. Scaling characteristics and asymptotic\nbehaviour of the SC/LM phase boundaries are considered. Single-particle spectra\nare investigated in some detail, for the SC phase in particular. Here, the\nmodified spectral functions are found to contain a generalized Kondo resonance\nthat is ubiquitously pinned at the Fermi level; and which exhibits a\ncharacteristic low-energy Kondo scale that narrows progressively upon approach\nto the SC->LM transition, where it vanishes. Universal scaling of the spectra\nas the transition is approached thus results. The scaling spectrum\ncharacteristic of the normal Anderson model is recovered as a particular case,\nand is captured quantitatively by the LMA. In all cases the r-dependent scaling\nspectra are found to possess characteristic low-energy asymptotics, but to be\ndominated by generalized Doniach-Sunjic tails, in agreement with LMA\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 1999 10:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This work is primarily motivated by the hope that this new viewpoint\nwill lead to a deeper understanding of dynamical triangulations in general.\nUltimately, this research programme may give a better insight into the\npotential application of dynamical triangulations to quantum gravity. This\nthesis serves as an exploratory study of this uncharted territory.\n  The five dimensional (k,l) moves used in the Monte Carlo algorithm are proven\nto be ergodic in the space of combinatorially equivalent simplicial\n5-manifolds.

On the basis of this observation a proposal is made for a new two\nsteps derivation of the electroweak standard model from the string dynamics. In\nthe first step a theory of Aristotelian top is formulated and studied in more\ndetail and in the second step an attempt is made to derive the electroweak\nstandard model from the top dynamics. Before the symmetry breaking fermions are\nrepresented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry under the\nrotation around their axes is interpreted as the group $U(1)_Y$. The emergence\nof $SU(2)_L$ group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connected\nwith the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the up\nand down type fermions. The symmetry breaking is associated with the bending of\nthe rotators under the influence of Higgs field and with their subsequent\ntransformation into the curved frozen strings - tops. In this new picture of\nelectroweak interaction the chirality of the theory has a simple and natural\nexplanation, the weak isospin and hypercharge are inherent properties of\nrelativistic rotators/tops and the superselection rule associated with electric\ncharge is a consequence of the accepted distinction between up and down type\nfermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 1999 11:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is equivalent to the minimality of an associated topological\ndynamical system with R^n-action. There is a lower bound for M(T) in terms of\nN(T), namely N(T) = O(M(T)^n), but no general upper bound.\n  The complexity of a repetitive Delone set can be measured by the growth rate\nof its repetitivity function M(T). For example, M(T) is bounded if and only if\nthe set is a crystal. A set is called is linearly repetitive if M(T) = O(T) and\ndensely repetitive if M(T) = O(N(T))^{1/n}). We show that linearly repetitive\nsets and densely repetitive sets have strict uniform patch frequencies, i.e.\nthe associated topological dynamical system is strictly ergodic. It follows\nthat such sets are diffractive. In the reverse direction, we construct a\nrepetitive Delone set in R^n which has\n  M(T) = O(T(log T)^{2/n}(log log log T)^{4/n}), but does not have uniform\npatch frequencies. Aperiodic linearly repetitive sets have many claims to be\nthe simplest class of aperiodic sets, and we propose considering them as a\nnotion of \"perfectly ordered quasicrystal\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 1999 22:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2000 00:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2003 04:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
