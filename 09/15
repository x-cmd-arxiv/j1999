I propose that this\ncorrelation results from dust formation above magnetic cool spots. The model\ndeals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is\nthat a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic\ncool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust\nformation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the\nequatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust\nformation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is\nhigh. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage\nthat it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation\nvelocities of less than $10^{-4}$ times the break-up velocity. Such velocities\ncan be achieved by a planet companion of mass $\\sim 0.1 M_{\\rm Jupiter}$ which\nspins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main\nsequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic cool\nspots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the\ndescendant PN.

The method begins by obtaining the equation of\nmotion of the distribution function in perturbation theory. The solution of\nthis equation of motion reveals secular terms that grow in time, the dynamical\nrenormalization group resums these secular terms in real time and leads\ndirectly to the quantum kinetic equation. We used this method to study the\nrelaxation in a cool gas of pions and sigma mesons in the O(4) chiral linear\nsigma model. We obtain in relaxation time approximation the pion and sigma\nmeson relaxation rates. We also find that in large momentum limit emission and\nabsorption of massless pions result in threshold infrared divergence in sigma\nmeson relaxation rate and lead to a crossover behavior in relaxation. We then\nstudy the relaxation of charged quasiparticles in scalar electrodynamics\n(SQED). While longitudinal, Debye screened photons lead to purely exponential\nrelaxation, transverse photons, only dynamically screened by Landau damping\nlead to anomalous relaxation, thus leading to a crossover between two different\nrelaxational regimes. We emphasize that infrared divergent damping rates are\nindicative of non-exponential relaxation and the dynamical renormalization\ngroup reveals the correct relaxation directly in real time. Finally we also\nshow that this method provides a natural framework to interpret and resolve the\nissue of pinch singularities out of equilibrium and establish a direct\ncorrespondence between pinch singularities and secular terms. We argue that\nthis method is particularly well suited to study quantum kinetics and transport\nin gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 1999 16:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2000 04:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Second, the\nUniverse expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present\nvalue.

Third, when inflation ends,\nthe Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During\nthe third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a\nfixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature\nremains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its\npresent value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify\nwith the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the\nUniverse reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the\nmature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models.
