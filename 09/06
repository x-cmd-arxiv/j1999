A novel kinetic equation is introduced to compute photon\nproduction far away from equilibrium in the large N limit and lowest order in\nthe electromagnetic coupling.During the early stages of the dynamics the photon\ndensity grows exponentially and asymptotically the amplitude and frequency\ndistribution becomes \\sim alpha m^2/[lambda^2 \\omega^3] with lambda the scalar\nself-coupling and m the scalar mass.In the case of a phase transition,electric\nand magnetic fields are correlated on distances xi(t) \\sim sqrt{t} during the\nearly stages and the power spectrum is peaked at low momentum. Magnetic and\nDebye screening masses are defined out of equilibrium. The magnetic mass\nvanishes out of equilibrium in this abelian models. The Debye mass turns to be\nm^2_{Deb} \\sim alpha m^2/lambda for a supercooled phase transition while in the\ncase of an oscillating order parameter an interpolating time dependent Debye\nmass grows as alpha sqrt{m t}/lambda due to a non-linear resonance at low\nmomentum in the charged particle distribution. The build-up of the transverse\nelectric conductivity is studied during the formation of the non-equilibrium\nplasma. Its long wavelength limit reaches a value sigma_{k\\approx 0} \\sim alpha\nm/lambda at the end of the stage of linear instabilities. Its asymptotic form\nin terms of the non-equilibrium particle distribution functions is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 1999 12:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2000 15:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
