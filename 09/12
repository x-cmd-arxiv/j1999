The approach, previously proposed in\n[gr-qc/9908032], is based on the variation of the vector field and the\nprojection tensor (instead of the given metric tensor) and their first partial\nderivatives. The previously proved property of non-commutativity of the\nvariation and the partial derivative in respect to the projection tensor has\nbeen used to find all the variations. Subsequently, motivated by some analogy\nwith the well-known (3+1) ADM projection formalism, an assumption has been made\nabout a zero-covariant derivative of the projection tensor in respect to the\nprojection connection. The combination of the equations for the variations of\nthe projective tensor with covariant and contravariant indices has lead to the\nderivation of an important and concisely written relation: the derivative of\nthe vector field length is equal to the ''twice'' projected along the vector\nfield initial Christoffell connection. The result is of interest due to the\nfollowing reasons: 1. It is a more general one and contains in itself a\nwell-known formulae in affine differential geometry for the so called\nequiaffine connections (admitting covariantly conserved tensor fields), for\nwhich the trace of the connection is equal to the gradient of the logarithm of\nthe vector field length. 2. The additional term is the projected (with the\nprojection tensor) initially given connection and accounts for the influence of\nthe reference system on the change of the vector field's length, measured in\nthis system. 3. The formulae has been obtained within the proposed formalism of\nnon-commuting variation and partial derivative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 1999 12:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
