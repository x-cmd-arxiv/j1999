The plasma is assumed\nto be initially homogeneous, in thermal equilibrium and with a straight and\nhomogeneous magnetic field frozen in. Depending on the particular form of the\nheating/cooling function, the plasma may act as a dissipative or active medium\nfor magnetoacoustic waves, while Alfven waves are not directly affected. An\nevolutionary equation for fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves in the single\nwave limit, has been derived and solved, allowing us to analyse the wave\nmodification by competition of weakly nonlinear and quasi-isentropic effects.\nIt was shown that the sign of the quasi-isentropic term determines the scenario\nof the evolution, either dissipative or active. In the dissipative case, when\nthe plasma is first order isentropically stable the magnetoacoustic waves are\ndamped and the time for shock wave formation is delayed. However, in the active\ncase when the plasma is isentropically overstable, the wave amplitude grows,\nthe strength of the shock increases and the breaking time decreases. The\nmagnitude of the above effects depends upon the angle between the wave vector\nand the magnetic field. For hot (T > 10^4 K) atomic plasmas with solar\nabundances either in the interstellar medium or in the solar atmosphere, as\nwell as for the cold (T < 10^3 K) ISM molecular gas, the range of temperature\nwhere the plasma is isentropically unstable and the corresponding time and\nlength-scale for wave breaking have been found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 1999 20:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that when the pipe radius is larger than a critical\nvalue, the solution of the new problem exists only up to a certain distance\nalong the axis.

The loss of existence is interpreted as a\nthermal explosion; the critical distance is the safe reactor's length. Both\nlaminar and developed turbulent flow regimes are considered.

Data were taken with a Au beam of\nmomentum of 11.5 A $GeV/c$ on a Pb or Pt target with different experimental\nsettings.
