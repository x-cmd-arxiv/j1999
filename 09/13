This incompatibility\nis expressed by the fundamental commutator [x, p_x]=i hbar, or equivalently,\nvia the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle Delta x Delta p_x sim hbar. A\nfurther stability-related phenomenon where the quantum realm plays a dramatic\nrole is the collapse of certain stars into white dwarfs and neutron stars.\nHere, an intervention of the Pauli exclusion principle, via the fermionic\ndegenerate pressure, stops the gravitational collapse. However, by the\nneutron-star stage the standard quantum realm runs dry. One is left with the\nproblematic collapse of a black hole. This essay is devoted to a concrete\nargument on why the black-hole spacetime itself should exhibit a quantum\nnature. The proposed quantum aspect of spacetime is shown to prevent the\ngeneral-relativistic dictated problematic collapse. The quantum nature of\nblack-hole spacetime is deciphered from a recent result on the universal\nequal-area spacing [=lambda_P^2 4 ln(3)] for black holes. In one interpretation\nof the emergent picture, an astrophysical black hole can fluctuate to\nsqrt{pi/ln(3)} approx 1.7 times its classical size, and thus allow radiation\nand matter to escape to the outside observers. These fluctuations I conjecture\nprovide a new source, perhaps beyond Hawking radiation, of intense radiation\nfrom astrophysical black holes and may be the primary source of observed\nradiation from those galactic cores what carry black hole(s). The presented\ninterpretation may be used as a criterion to choose black holes from black hole\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 1999 00:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
