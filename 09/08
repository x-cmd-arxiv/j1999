The detailed history of HeII reionization at higher\nredshifts is, however, model-dependent and difficult to determine from these\nobservations, because the IGM can be completely optically thick to Lya photons\nwhen only a small fraction of the helium remains as HeII. In addition, finding\nquasars in which the HeII Lya absorption can be observed becomes increasingly\ndifficult at higher redshift, owing to the large abundance of hydrogen Lyman\nlimit systems.\n  It is pointed out here that HeII in the IGM should also cause detectable\ncontinuum absorption in the soft X-rays.

These data are used to\ninvestigate the morphology and extinction of the starburst ring and to study\nits star forming properties and history by comparing the observed quantities\nwith an evolutionary population synthesis model. The clumpy morphology of NGC\n7771 varies strongly with wavelength, due to the combination of extinction (for\nwhich we derive an average value of A_V = 2.8), emission from hot dust and red\nsupergiants, and several stellar generations in the ring. Also, the ellipticity\nand the position angle of the ring depend on the wavelength. The starburst ring\nin NGC 7771 exhibits small BrGamma equivalent widths. Assuming a constant star\nformation model with M_u = 100 M_sun results in very long lifetimes of the star\nforming regions (up to 1 Gyr), in disagreement with the clumpy near-infrared\nmorphology and the observed radio spectral index of NGC 7771. This situation is\nonly slightly remedied by assuming a reduced upper mass cutoff (M_u = 30\nM_sun), resulting in ages between 8 and 180 Myr. We prefer an instantaneous\nstar formation model with M_u = 100 M_sun which can explain the derived BrGamma\nequivalent widths if a single starburst occurred 6-7 Myr ago. The main\nexcitation mechanism of the molecular gas, based on the observed S(1)/BrGamma\nratio, appears to be excitation by UV radiation from hot young stars. We derive\nM = 1900 M_sun for the mass of the excited H_2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1999 14:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To solve them we propose a notion of rule\nconsistency that can be expressed in terms of rules derived from the explicit\nrepresentation of the initial constraints.\n  This notion of local consistency is weaker than arc consistency for\nconstraints of arbitrary arity but coincides with it when all domains are unary\nor binary. For Boolean constraints rule consistency coincides with the closure\nunder the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints.\n  By generalizing the format of the rules we obtain a characterization of arc\nconsistency in terms of so-called inclusion rules. The advantage of rule\nconsistency and this rule based characterization of the arc consistency is that\nthe algorithms that enforce both notions can be automatically generated, as CHR\nrules. So these algorithms could be integrated into constraint logic\nprogramming systems such as Eclipse.\n  We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to constraint propagation by\ndiscussing the implementations of both algorithms and their use on various\nexamples, including Boolean constraints, three valued logic of Kleene,\nconstraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedreal scenes,\nand Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1999 14:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The possibility of\nproving a $c$-theorem in this framework is discussed, in particular in relation\nto the coefficients $c,a$, which appear in the energy momentum tensor trace on\ngeneral curved backgrounds in four dimensions. Ward identities relating the\ncorrelation functions are derived and explicit expressions are obtained for\nfree scalar, spinor field theories in general dimensions and also free vector\nfields in dimension four. A natural geometric formalism which is independent of\nany choice of coordinates is used and the role of conformal symmetries on such\nconstant curvature spaces is analysed. The results are shown to be constrained\nby the operator product expansion. For negative curvature the spectral\nrepresentation, involving unitary positive energy representations of\n$O(d-1,2)$, for two point functions of vector currents is derived in detail and\nextended to the energy momentum tensor by analogy. It is demonstrated that, at\nnon coincident points, the two point functions are not related to $a$ in any\ndirect fashion and there is no straightforward demonstration obtainable in this\nframework of irreversibility under renormalisation group flow of any function\nof the couplings for four dimensional field theories which reduces to $a$ at\nfixed points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1999 11:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 1999 17:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 1999 16:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
