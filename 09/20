This tripod linkage is an extension of the standard\nlaser-induced continuum structure (LICS) which involves two discrete states and\ntwo lasers. We show that in the tripod scheme, there exist two population\ntrapping conditions; in some cases these conditions are easier to satisfy than\nthe single trapping condition in two-state LICS. Depending on the pulse timing,\nvarious effects can be observed. We derive some basic properties of the tripod\nscheme, such as the solution for coincident pulses, the behaviour of the system\nin the adiabatic limit for delayed pulses, the conditions for no ionization and\nfor maximal ionization, and the optimal conditions for population transfer\nbetween the discrete states via the continuum. In the case when one of the\ndiscrete states is strongly coupled to the continuum, the population dynamics\nreduces to a standard two-state LICS problem (involving the other two states)\nwith modified parameters; this provides the opportunity to customize the\nparameters of a given two-state LICS system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 1999 11:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In deriving these results we start from the\nMoser formula for the A_r series and obtain the results for the other classical\nseries of Lie algebras by imposing appropriate involutions on the scattering\ndata. Thus we also show how Moser's solution goes into the one of Olshanetsky\nand Perelomov.
