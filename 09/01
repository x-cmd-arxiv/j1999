Similar to single-mass models, velocity anisotropy develops as the\ncluster evolves, but the degree of anisotropy is much smaller than isolated\nclusters. Except for very early epochs of the cluster evolution, nearly all\nmass components become tangentially anisotropic at the outer parts. We have\ncompared our results with multi-mass, King-Michie models. The isotropic King\nmodel better fits to the Fokker-Planck results because of tangential\nanisotropy. However, it is almost impossible to fit the computed density\nprofiles to the multi-mass King models for all mass components. Thus if one\nattempts to derive global mass function based on the observed mass function in\nlimited radial range using multi-mass King models, one may get somewhat erratic\nresults, especially for low mass stars. We have examined how the mass function\nchanges in time. Specifically, we find that the power-law index of the mass\nfunction decreases monotonically with the total mass of the cluster. This\nappears to be consistent with the behaviour of the observed slopes of mass\nfunctions for a limited number of clusters, although it is premature to compare\nquantitatively because there are other mechanisms in contributing the\nevaporation of stars from the clusters. The projected velocity profiles for\nanisotropic models with the apocenter criterion for evaporation show\nsignificant flattening toward the tidal radius compared to isotropic model or\nanisotropic model with the energy criterion.

The angular size of a causally\nconnected region within a relativistic flow is of the order the angular width\nof the relativistic beaming, $\\gamma^{-1}$. Thus, different observers along\ndifferent lines of sights could see drastically different fluxes from the same\nburst. Specifically, we propose that the most energetic bursts correspond to\nexceptionally bright spots along the line of sight on colliding shells, and do\nnot represent much larger energy release in the explosion. We calculate the\ndistribution function of the observed fluence for random angular-fluctuation of\nejecta. We find that the width of the distribution function for the observed\nfluence is about two orders of magnitude if the number of shells ejected along\ndifferent lines of sight is ten or less. The distribution function becomes\nnarrower if number of shells along typical lines of sight increases. The\nanalysis of the $\\gamma$-ray fluence and afterglow emissions for GRBs with\nknown redshifts provides support for our model i.e. the large width of GRB\nluminosity function is not due to a large spread in the energy release but\ninstead is due to large angular fluctuations in ejected material. We outline\nseveral observational tests of this model. In particular, we predict little\ncorrelation between the $\\gamma$-ray fluence and the afterglow emission as in\nfact is observed. We predict that the early (minutes to hours) afterglow would\ndepict large temporal fluctuations whose amplitude decreases with time. Finally\nwe predict that there should be many weak bursts with about average afterglow\nluminosity in this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 1999 14:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Using bosonization\nmethods, we discuss how the 1D system exhibits a crossover from the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid to the Wigner crystal when $\\alpha \\to 1$. In\nparticular, a detailed analysis is given to the Fermi-edge singularity\nphenomena when a {\\it mobile} core hole is created suddenly in the valence\nband. It is found that the effect due to the core-hole motion on the Fermi-edge\nsingularity is gradually suppressed as the system approaches the Wigner\ncrystal, and its critical behavior is dominated by the ordinary impurity\nforward-scattering inherent in a static hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 1999 08:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1999 11:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Within the\nmodel, we find that the strong increase of the ratios with the number of\nparticipants is mainly due to hadronic rescattering of produced mesons with\ningoing baryons and their resonances. The enhancement of K/pi in heavy-ion\ncollisions with respect to elementary p+p interactions is larger at AGS energy\nthan SPS energy, and decreases smoothly with bombarding energy. The total\nmultiplicity ratios at RHIC energy are predicted by RQMD to be K+/pi+ = 0.19\nand K-/pi- = 0.15.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 1999 00:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2000 23:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These properties are intrinsic to real\nflows and the conventional Navier-Stokes equations.\n  A description of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid, which reconciles the\ndifferences between the various schools of A.L.E. thought in the literature is\nderived for the purposes of this investigation. The issue of whether these\nequations automatically inherit the afore mentioned energetic properties must\nfirst be resolved. In this way natural notions of nonlinear, exponential-type\ndissipation in the absence of forcing and long-term stability under conditions\nof time dependent loading are also formulated.\n  The findings of this analysis have profound consequences for the use of\ncertain classes of finite difference schemes in the context of deforming\nreferences. It is significant that many algorithms presently in use do not\nautomatically inherit the fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.\n  The main conclusions are drawn on in the simulation of a driven cavity flow,\na driven cavity flow with various, included rigid bodies, a die-swell problem,\nand a Stokes second order wave. The improved, second order accuracy of a new\nscheme for the linearised approximation of the convective term is proved for\nthe purposes of these simulations.
