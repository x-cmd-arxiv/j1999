The absence of\nworld-spanning aurorae in historical records and of anomalous extinctions in\nthe geological record indicate that our Sun likely does not suffer superflares.\nIn seeking to explain this new phenomenon, we are struck by its similarity to\nlarge stellar flares on RS Canum Venaticorum binary systems, which are caused\nby magnetic reconnection events associated with the tangling of magnetic fields\nbetween the two stars. The superflare stars are certainly not of this class,\nalthough we propose a similar flare mechanism. That is, superflares are caused\nby magnetic reconnection between fields of the primary star and a close-in\nJovian planet.

At Los Alamos the CINDER'90 code and library\nhave been developed for nuclide inventory calculations using neutron-reaction\n(En < 20 MeV) and/or decay data for 3400 nuclides; coupled with the LAHET Code\nSystem (LCS), irradiations in neutron and proton environments below a few GeV\nare tractable; additional work with the European Activation File, the HMS-ALICE\ncode and the reaction models of MCNPX (CEM95, BERTINI, or ISABEL with or\nwithout preequilibrium, evaporation and fission) have been used to produce\nevaluated reaction data for neutrons and protons to 1.7 GeV. At the Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory, efforts have focused on production of medical\nisotopes and the identification of available neutron reaction data from results\nof integral measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 1999 19:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is done by first\nmapping the vibrational state to be teleported into the internal degrees of\nfreedom of a given ion. Then we handle with the internal superposition state\nfollowing Bennett's original protocol and a recently proposed technique for\nteleportation of ionic internal states [quant-ph/9903029]. Finally, the\nteleportation of the vibrational state is achieved by reversing the mapping\nprocess in the receiver ion. We remark that as in the teleportation of cavity\nfield and atomic states, the teleportation of vibrational states is 100%\nsuccessful for an ideal process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 1999 16:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
