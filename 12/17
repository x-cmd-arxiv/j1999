Our model is aimed at describing neutral evolution of natural\nproteins. We use a cubic lattice model of the protein structure and test the\nneutrality conditions by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that\nsequence space is traversed by neutral networks, i.e. sets of sequences with\nthe same fold connected by point mutations. Typical pairs of sequences on a\nneutral network are nearly as different as randomly chosen sequences. The\nfraction of neutral neighbors has strong sequence to sequence variations, which\ninfluence the rate of neutral evolution. In this paper we study the\nthermodynamic stability of different protein sequences. We relate the high\nvariability of the fraction of neutral mutations to the complex energy\nlandscape within a neutral network, arguing that valleys in this landscape are\nassociated to high values of the neutral mutation rate. We find that when a\npoint mutation produces a sequence with a new ground state, this is likely to\nhave a low stability. Thus we tentatively conjecture that neutral networks of\ndifferent structures are typically well separated in sequence space.

After reviewing how this information has\nbeen previously exploited by others, we describe extensions which add power to\nbreakpoint detection and characterization. We show how complete fits to the\nentire track, with breakpoint parameters added, can be easily obtained from the\ninformation from unbroken fits. Tests inspired by the Fisher F-test can then be\nused to judge breakpoints. Signed quantities (such as change in momentum at the\nbreakpoint) can supplement unsigned quantities such as the various chisquares.\nWe illustrate the method with electrons from real data, and with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of pion decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 1999 20:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The usual quantum theory of\nentangled systems assumes we have rotational invariance (RI), so that\ncoincidence rates depend on the difference only between detector settings, not\non the absolute values. Bell tests, as such, do not necessarily require RI, but\nwhere it fails the presentation of results in the form of coincidence curves\ncan be grossly misleading. Even if the well-known detection loophole were\nclosed, the visibility of such curves would tell us nothing about the degree of\nentanglement! The problem may be especially relevant to recent experiments\nusing \"degenerate type II parametric down-conversion\" sources. Logical analysis\nof the results of many experiments suggests realist explanations involving some\nnew physics. The systems may be more nearly deterministic than quantum theory\nimplies.
