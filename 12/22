The bright inner ring of the nebula is interpreted to be the \"equatorial\"\ndensity enhancement. It contains a number of low-ionization knots and outward\ntails that we ascribe to dynamical instabilities leading to fragmentation of\nthe ring or transient density enhancements due to the interaction of the\nionization front with previous density fluctuations in the ISM. The lobes show\na pronounced point-symmetric morphology and two peculiar low-ionization\nfilaments whose nature remains unclear. The most notable characteristic of He\n2-186 is the presence of two high-velocity (higher than 135 km/s) knots from\nwhich an S-shaped lane of emission departs toward the central star. K 4-47 is\ncomposed of a compact core and two high-velocity, low-ionization blobs. We\ninterpret the substantial broadening of line emission from the blobs as a\nsignature of bow shocks, and using the modeling of Hartigan, Raymond, & Hartman\n(1987), we derive a shock velocity of 150 km/s and a mild inclination of the\noutflow on the plane of the sky. We discuss possible scenarios for the\nformation of these nebulae and their low-ionization features. In particular,\nthe morphology of K 4-47 hardly fits into any of the usually adopted mass-loss\ngeometries for single AGB stars. Finally, we discuss the possibility that\npoint-symmetric morphologies in the lobes of NGC 6337 and the knots of He 2-186\nare the result of precessing outflows from the central stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 1999 12:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This implies that the mass of the axion\ncan be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby\nproviding a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the\nnew phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino\noscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to\n``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This\ndecoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we\ndiscuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,\nand propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the\naxion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an\ninfinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the\ndissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion\noscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to\nexceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds.
