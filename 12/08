This power law part is\nindependent of the details of star formation inside each clump and therefore\nhas a universal character. The flat part of the IMF at low mass is proposed\nhere to result from a second, unrelated, physical process that determines only\nthe probability distribution function for final star mass inside a clump of a\ngiven mass, and is independent of both this clump mass and the overall cloud\nstructure. Both processes operate for all potentially unstable clumps in a\ncloud, regardless of mass, but only the first shows up above the thermal Jeans\nmass, and only the second shows up below this mass.

The Higgs boson mass is chosen to be in\nthe energy interval 75 GeV $\\le m_H \\le$ 115 GeV. The effective potential\ncalculated is real at sufficiently high temperatures due to mutual cancellation\nof the imaginary terms entering the one-loop and the daisy diagram parts.\nSymmetry behaviour shows that neither the magnetic nor the hypermagnetic field\ndoes not produce the sufficiently strong first order phase transition. For the\nfield strengths $H, H_Y$ $\\ge 10^{23}$ G the electroweak phase transition is of\nsecond order at all. Therefore, baryogenesis does not survive in the Standard\nModel in smooth magnetic fields.
