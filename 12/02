This\npicture is supported by tight Mg-sigma and colour-magnitude relations at\nvarious redshifts and age/metallicity diagnostic diagrams. On the other hand,\nthere is a strong decline in the frequency of S0 galaxies with redshift, while\na significant proportion of the galaxies have disturbed morphologies and signs\nof ongoing interaction/merging. Numerous post-starburst galaxies are found as\nwell as passive spiral galaxies. This raises the question whether the spiral\ngalaxies falling into the cluster from the surrounding field could be\ntransformed into S0 galaxies. A possible scenario would be that the\nintracluster medium first deprives the spirals of all their gas leading to the\nend of star formation. The subsequent evolution within the tidal field of the\ncluster could then turn the spirals into S0 galaxies over the ages.\n  The study of a great number of early-type galaxies per cluster including\nsub-L* galaxies reveals, however, that this picture needs some finetuning since\nthe relations mentioned above have a larger spread than those based on the\nobservation of just a few luminous galaxies.

Our results\nagree with the fundamental line emission characteristics of active galactic\nnuclei within the model uncertainties if the following additional assumptions\nare made: 1) the mean stellar mass loss rates decrease with distance from the\nblack hole, and 2) the mean ionization parameters are lower than those\npostulated in Kazanas (1989). For models with enhanced mass loss, the\nzero-intensity-full-widths of the line profiles are proportional to the black\nhole mass to the power of 1/3. This scaling relation suggests that the black\nhole masses of NLS1s (narrow-line Seyfert 1s) are relatively low. Models with\nenhanced mass loss also predict minimum line/continuum delays that are\nproportional to the zero-intensity-full-widths of the profiles. Because of\ntheir high column densities, these models yield triangle-shaped response\nfunctions, which are not generally observed. On the other hand, models without\nenhanced mass loss yield line-continuum delays that are proportional to the\nsquare root of the continuum luminosity, which is constant with empirical\nresults. Models with high enough intercloud (interstellar) medium densities and\na BLR-occulting accretion disk have line shifts. The broadest line emission and\nabsorption profile components of lines similar to C IV, N V, and O VI are\nredshifted. Conversely, the narrowest emission and absorption profile\ncomponents are blueshifted in such models. These results appear to agree with\nobservations (e.g., Done & Krolik 1996).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 1999 22:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Based on the principles of Bayesian\nstatistics, a particular Bayesian field theory is defined by combining two\nmodels: a likelihood model, providing a probabilistic description of the\nmeasurement process, and a prior model, providing the information necessary to\ngeneralize from training to non-training data. The particular likelihood models\ndiscussed in the paper are those of general density estimation, Gaussian\nregression, clustering, classification, and models specific for inverse quantum\nproblems. Besides problem typical hard constraints, like normalization and\npositivity for probabilities, prior models have to implement all the specific,\nand often vague, \"a priori\" knowledge available for a specific task.\nNonparametric prior models discussed in the paper are Gaussian processes,\nmixtures of Gaussian processes, and non-quadratic potentials. Prior models are\nmade flexible by including hyperparameters. In particular, the adaption of mean\nfunctions and covariance operators of Gaussian process components is discussed\nin detail. Even if constructed using Gaussian process building blocks, Bayesian\nfield theories are typically non-Gaussian and have thus to be solved\nnumerically. According to increasing computational resources the class of\nnon-Gaussian Bayesian field theories of practical interest which are\nnumerically feasible is steadily growing.
