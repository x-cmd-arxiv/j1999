It is well known that for small transverse\nsize dipoles this cross section is related to the leading-log gluon density.\nUsing the measured pion-proton cross section as a guide, we suggest a\nreasonable extrapolation of the dipole cross section to the large transverse\nsize region. We point out that the observed magnitude and small $x$ rise of the\ngluon density from conventional fits implies that the DGLAP approximation has a\nrestricted region of applicability. We found that `higher twist' or unitarity\ncorrections are required in, or close to, the HERA kinematic region, even for\nsmall `perturbative' dipoles for scattering at central impact parameters. This\nmeans that the usual perturbative leading twist description, for moderate\nvirtualities, $1 < Q^2 < 10$ GeV$^2$, has rather large `higher twist'\ncorrections at small $x$. In addition, for these virtualities, we also find\nsizeable contributions from large non-perturbative dipoles ($b \\gsim 0.4$ fm)\nto $F_2$, and also to $F_L$. This also leads to deviations from the standard\nleading twist DGLAP results, at small $x$ and moderate $Q^2$. Our model also\ndescribes the low $Q^2$ data very well without any further tuning. We\ngeneralize the Gribov unitarity limit for the structure functions of a hadron\ntarget to account for the blackening of the interaction at central impact\nparameters and to include scattering at peripheral impact parameters which\ndominate at extremely large energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 1999 18:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2000 11:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

The algorithm has a second-order convergence of moments in a finite\ntime interval and requires the sampling of only one uniformly distributed\nrandom variable per time step. The noise may be white or colored. We apply the\nalgorithm to a study of the approach towards equilibrium of an oscillator\ncoupled nonlinearly to a heat bath and investigate the effect of the\nmultiplicative noise (arising from the nonlinear coupling) on the relaxation\ntime. This allows us to test the regime of validity of the energy-envelope\napproximation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 1999 21:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2000 18:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The approach is exponentially convergent and more efficient than the\nHyperspherical Coordinate(HC) method and the Correlation Function\nHyperspherical Harmonic(CFHH) method. This approach is numerically competitive\nwith the variational methods, such as that using the Hylleraas-type basis\nfunctions. Numerical comparisons are made to demonstrate them, by calculating\nthe non-relativistic and infinite-nuclear-mass limit of the ground state energy\nof the helium atom. The exponentially convergency of this approach is due to\nthe full matching between the analytical structure of the basis functions that\nI use and the true wave function. This full matching was not reached by almost\nany other methods. For example, the variational method using the Hylleraas-type\nbasis does not reflects the logarithmic singularity of the true wave function\nat the origin as predicted by Bartlett and Fock. Two important approaches are\nproposed in this work to reach this full matching: the coordinate\ntransformation method and the asymptotic series method. Besides these, this\nwork makes use of the least square method to substitute complicated numerical\nintegrations in solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, without much loss of\naccuracy; this method is routinely used by people to fit a theoretical curve\nwith discrete experimental data, but I use it here to simplify the computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 1999 05:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2000 11:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
