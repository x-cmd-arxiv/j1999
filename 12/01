The emission line spectrum\nas well as the excess continuum emission are common probes of this process. In\nthis communication, we present additional probes of the circumstellar\nenvironment in the form of resonance lines of low ionization potential\nelements. Using a set of 14 high resolution echelle observations of the\nclassical T Tauri star (CTTS), RW Aur, taken between 1986 and 1996, we\ncarefully measure the continuum veiling at each epoch by comparing more than\n500 absorption lines with those of an appropriate template. This allows us to\naccurately subtract out the continuum emission and to recover the underlying\nphotospheric spectrum. In doing so, we find that selected photospheric lines\nare enhanced by the accretion process, namely the resonance lines of LiI and\nKI. A resonance line of TiI and a low excitation potential line of CaI also\nshow weak enhancements. Simple slab models and computed line bisectors lead us\nto propose that these line enhancements are markers of cool gas at the\nbeginning of the accretion flow which provides an additional source of line\nopacity. These results suggest that published values of surface lithium\nabundances of classical T Tauri stars are likely to be overestimated. This\nwould account for the various reports of surface lithium abundances in excess\nof meteoritic values among the extreme CTTS. Computing LTE lithium abundances\nof RW Aur in a low and then high accretion state yields abundances which vary\nby one order of magnitude. The low accretion state lithium abundance is\nconsistent with theoretical predictions for a star of this age and mass while\nthe high accretion state spectrum yields a super-meteoritic lithium abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1999 18:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In essence, an optimal reconstruction algorithm\nis applied to the continuum band (2-4keV) light curve which smoothes out noise\nand interpolates across the data gaps.

The N emission\nlines also show the velocity structure of a bipolar outflow expanding at 100\nkm/s on average. This implies that, for a measured radius of 1.2 pc, the\noutflow originated about 12000 yrs ago. The line flux ratio [NII]6584/[SII]6717\nindicates that the nebula is nitrogen enriched and therefore it has been\nejected from the central star. This is the first bipolar, ejection nebula\ndetected around a well-established B[e] supergiant. The bipolar morphology and\nthe chemical enrichment shown by the nebula associated with R4 are consistent\nwith the picture of a binary merger (Langer & Heger 1998), in which R4 was\noriginally a system composed by a close pair and a third star (the observed A\ncompanion). The close pair merged into a single star and the merging process\nproduced a circumstellar nebula that was later shaped by the ensueing B star\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 1999 15:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is proposed that GRBs are created inside a pre-existing jet from\na neutron star in a binary system which collapses to a black hole due to\naccretion. In our model we assume that a fraction of the initial energy due to\nthis transition is deposited in the jet by magnetic fields. The observed\nemission is then due to an ultrarelativistic shock wave propagating along the\njet. Good agreement with observational data can be obtained for systems such as\nthe Galactic jet source SS433. Specifically, we are able to reproduce the\ntypical observed afterglow emission flux, its spectrum as a function of time,\nand the fluence distribution of the corrected data for the 4B BATSE catalogue.\nWe also studied the relation between the cosmological evolution of our model\nand the cosmic ray energy distribution. We used the Star Formation Rate (SFR)\nas a function of redshift to obtain the distribution in fluences of GRBs in our\nmodel. The fluence in the gamma ray band has been used to calculate the energy\nin cosmic rays both in our Galaxy and at extragalactic distances.
