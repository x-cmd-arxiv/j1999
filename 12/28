Next it is shown that when Q=0 the\nspinning black hole may be obtained from the one with J=0 by a Lorentz boost in\nthe $\\phi -t$ plane.

At variance with\nprevious analyses truncated Cornwall-Norton moments, limited to the\nnucleon-resonance production regions, are considered. The role played by\ntarget-mass corrections is illustrated, showing that target-mass effects are\nnecessary (but not sufficient) for producing the observed Bloom-Gilman duality\nof the nucleon structure function. The possibility of a local duality between\nthe unphysical region at large values of the Nachtmann variable and the nucleon\nelastic peak contribution is analyzed. It is found that the proton magnetic\nform factor extracted assuming local duality is significantly below the\nexperimental data at low and intermediate values of Q**2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 1999 11:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2000 07:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We consider the variational basis functions of the type exp(-a_n r_1 -\nb_n r_2 - g_n r_12) with complex exponents. The method yields the best\navailable energies for the ground states of the helium atom and the positive\nhydrogen ion as well as many other known atomic and molecular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 1999 13:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Coherent information was calculated for the information decay\nin a two-level atom in the presence of an external resonant field, for the\ninformation exchange between two coupled two-level atoms, and for the\ninformation transfer from a two-level atom to another atom and to a photon\nfield. The coherent information is shown to be equal to zero for all\nfull-measurement procedures, but it completely retains its original value for\nquantum duplication. Transmission of information from one open subsystem to\nanother one in the entire closed system is analyzed to learn quantum\ninformation about the forbidden atomic transition via a dipole active\ntransition of the same atom. It is argued that coherent information can be used\neffectively to quantify the information channels in physical systems where\nquantum coherence plays an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 1999 09:13:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2000 15:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2000 14:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
