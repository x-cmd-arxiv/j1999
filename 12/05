A systematic diagram technique\nis developed for perturbation study of the current in physical systems out of\nequilibrium governed by time - dependent Hamiltonians of the Anderson and the\nKondo models. The ensuing calculations prove to be too complicated for the\nAnderson model, and hence, a mapping on an effective Kondo problem is called\nfor. This is achieved by constructing a time - dependent version of the\nSchrieffer - Wolff transformation. Perturbation expansion of the current is\nthen carried out up to third order in the Kondo coupling J yielding a set of\nremarkably simple analytical expressions for the current. The zero - bias\nanomaly of the direct current differential conductance is shown to be\nsuppressed by the alternating field while side peaks develop at finite source -\ndrain voltage. Both the direct component and the first harmonics of the time -\ndependent response are equally enhanced due to the Kondo effect, while\namplitudes of higher harmonics are shown to be relatively small. A zero\nalternating bias anomaly is found in the alternating current differential\nconductance, that is, it peaks around zero alternating bias. This peak is\nsuppressed by the constant bias. No side peaks show up in the differential\nalternating - conductance but their counterpart is found in the derivative of\nthe alternating current with respect to the direct bias. The results pertaining\nto nonlinear response are shown to be valid also below the Kondo temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 1999 15:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
