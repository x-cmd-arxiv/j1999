I will give an introduction to the problem, and then focus on some\nrecent work concerning the so-called ``designability principle''. The\ndesignability of a structure is measured by the number of sequences that have\nthat structure as their unique ground state. Structures differ drastically in\nterms of their designability; highly designable structures emerge with a number\nof associated sequences much larger than the average. These highly designable\nstructures 1) possess ``proteinlike'' secondary structures and motifs, 2) are\nthermodynamically more stable, and 3) fold faster than other structures. These\nresults suggest that protein structures are selected in nature because they are\nreadily designed and stable against mutations, and that such selection\nsimultaneously leads to thermodynamic stability and foldability. According to\nthis picture, a key to the protein folding problem is to understand the\nemergence and the properties of the highly designable structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 1999 22:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This theory is based on the application of\nsemiclassical methods and random matrix theory to linear response of many-body\nsystems. The theory is developed in the approximation wherein the many-body\nsystem can be treated as a single particle in an effective, time-dependent\nmean-field. We find semiclassical expressions for energy dissipation relevant\nin one-body dissipation in heavy nuclei. We also show that this energy\ndissipation, related to damping of collective excitations, is irreversible. The\nirreversibility is proved by our development of a quantum diffusion equation.\nIt may be noted that the quantum diffusion equation is derived from the von\nNeumann equation and makes no assumption about the initial form of the density\noperator. It is shown that, in the semiclassical limit, the quantum diffusion\nequation reduces to the classical Smoluchowski equation. Further, we show that\nthe dissipation is a purely quantal phenomenon as it is related to the\ngeometric phase acquired by a single-particle wavefunction as the system\nevolves in a slow-varying mean-field. It is explicitly shown that the\ndissipation rate is related to the nature of dynamics and the spectrum of the\nclassical Liouvillian operator. Finally, we present an expression for the\nviscosity tensor encountered in nuclear fission in terms of periodic orbits of\nthe single particle in an adiabatically deforming nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 1999 05:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
