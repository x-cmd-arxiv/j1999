We first show that the Q-field theory used previously to describe a\ndisordered Fermi liquid also has a saddle-point solution that describes a\nferromagnet in a disordered Stoner approximation. We calculate transport\ncoefficients and thermodynamic susceptibilities by expanding about the saddle\npoint to Gaussian order. At this level, the theory generalizes previous\nRPA-type theories by including quenched disorder. We then study soft-mode\neffects in the ferromagnetic state in a one-loop approximation. In\nthree-dimensions, we find that the spin waves induce a square-root frequency\ndependence of the conductivity, but not of the density of states, that is\nqualitatively the same as the usual weak-localization effect induced by the\ndiffusive soft modes. In contrast to the weak-localization anomaly, this effect\npersists also at nonzero temperatures. In two-dimensions, however, the spin\nwaves do not lead to a logarithmic frequency dependence. This explains\nexperimental observations in thin ferromagnetic films, and it provides a basis\nfor the construction of a simple effective field theory for the transition from\na ferromagnetic metal to a ferromagnetic insulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 1999 18:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2000 19:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One is based upon the idea that view the pseudogap as\nderiving from some of precursor superconductivity. Another assumes that\nassociate the pseudogap phenomena with magnetic pairing of some sort. Both the\nscenario of superconducting fluctuation and the scenario of magnetic pairing of\nsome sort on the pseudogap in underdoped cuprate are based upon the idea that a\nfluctuation of a certain type exists at temperatures higher than the usual\nsuperconducting transition temperature and has an effect on the single particl\nself-energy and just such a self-energy leads to the gap-like structure of the\nspectral weight.
