It was found that\nelectron correlation and electron-phonon coupling compete against each other,\nand strong electron correlations suppress the charge-ordered insulating state.\nThis allows extended polarons to form in the strong electron-phonon coupling\nregime. It is shown that in this regime two polarons may form a pair via phonon\nmediated charge-fluctuation interaction. Based on the results we propose a\nnovel mechanism of hole pairing. This mechanism could be relevant to High-Tc\ncuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 1999 17:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2000 07:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An angle theta_nu characterizes the kind of the neutrinos, with\ntheta_nu=0 for Dirac neutrinos and theta_nu=pi/2 for Majorana neutrinos. At\ntheta_nu = 0 baryon-minus-lepton number is conserved. If theta_nu is\napproximately zero, the six neutrino masses coalesce into three nearly\ndegenerate pairs. Thus the tiny mass differences exhibited in the solar and\natmospheric neutrino experiments are naturally explained by the approximate\nconservation of B-L. Neutrinos are nearly Dirac fermions.\n  This B-L model leads to these predictions: neutrinos oscillate mainly between\nflavor eigenfields and sterile eigenfields, and so the appearance of neutrinos\nand antineutrinos is suppressed; neutrinos may well be of cosmological\nimportance; in principle the disappearance of the tau neutrino should be\nobservable; and neutrinoless double-beta decay is suppressed by an extra factor\nof 10^(-5) and so will not be seen in the Heidelberg/Moscow, IGEX, GENIUS, or\nCUORE experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 1999 12:19:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2000 07:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2000 23:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
