We report new observations\nof the J = (4-3), (2-1), and (1-0) transitions of CO towards eight\nhigh-latitude clouds. The new observations are combined with data from the\nliterature to show that the emission from all observed CO transitions is\nlinearly correlated. This implies that the excitation conditions which lead to\nemission in these transitions are uniform throughout the clouds. Observed\n13CO/12CO (1-0) integrated intensity ratios are generally much greater than the\nexpected abundance ratio of the two species, indicating that the regions which\nemit 12CO (1-0) radiation are optically thick.

The potential introduced by the simultaneous gauging is the sum of\nthe potentials introduced by gauging K and U(1)_R separately. We present a list\nof possible gauge groups K and the corresponding representations of tensor\nfields. For the exceptional supergravity we find that one can gauge the SO^*(6)\nsubgroup of the isometry group E_{6(-26)} of the scalar manifold if one\ndualizes 12 of the vector fields to tensor fields just as in the gauged N=8\nsupergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 1999 21:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

It is based on a new concept of involutive monomial division which is\ndefined for a monomial set. Such a division provides for each monomial the\nself-consistent separation of the whole set of variables into two disjoint\nsubsets. They are called multiplicative and non-multiplicative. Given an\nadmissible ordering, this separation is applied to polynomials in terms of\ntheir leading monomials. As special cases of the separation we consider those\nintroduced by Janet, Thomas and Pommaret for the purpose of algebraic analysis\nof partial differential equations. Given involutive division, we define an\ninvolutive reduction and an involutive normal form. Then we introduce, in terms\nof the latter, the concept of involutivity for polynomial systems. We prove\nthat an involutive system is a special, generally redundant, form of a Groebner\nbasis. An algorithm for construction of involutive bases is proposed. It is\nshown that involutive divisions satisfying certain conditions, for example,\nthose of Janet and Thomas, provide an algorithmic construction of an involutive\nbasis for any polynomial ideal.
