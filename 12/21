The\nmeasurements mainly extend those of presented in Paper I adding three more\nstars (AW Per, SV Vul, T Mon). The spectra were obtained in the interval of\n5900 A and 6660 A. New radial velocities determined with the cross-correlation\ntechnique and the bisector technique are presented. We found systematic\ndifferences between the spectroscopic and CORAVEL-type measurements as large as\n1-3 km/s in certain phases. We performed Baade-Wesselink analysis for CK Cam\ndiscovered by the Hipparcos satellite. The resulting radius is 31+/-1 Ro, which\nis in very good agreement with recent period-radius relation by Gieren et al.\n(1999). Observational pieces of evidence of possible velocity gradient\naffecting the individual line profiles are studied. The FWHM of the metallic\nlines, similarly to the velocity differences, shows a very characteristic phase\ndependence, illustrating the effect of global compression in the atmosphere.\nThe smallest line widths always occur around the maximal radius, while the\nlargest FWHM is associated with the velocity reversal before the minimal\nradius. Three first overtone pulsators do not follow the general trend: the\nlargest FWHM in SU Cas and SZ Tau occurs after the smallest radius, during the\nexpansion, while in V1334 Cyg there are only barely visible FWHM-variations.\nThe possibility of a bright yellow companion of V1334 Cyg is briefly discussed.\nThe observed line profile asymmetries can be partly associated with the\nvelocity gradient, which is also supported by the differences between\nindividual line velocities of different excitation potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 1999 09:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One important consideration in designing\nadaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible\nto machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL)\ntechniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting\nagents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the\nagents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg\ngames. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control\nnetwork packet routing.\n  We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps\nsurprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be\nbetter suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential\nperformance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents\nachieve throughputs up to three and one half times better than that of the\nstandard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol\ntraffic is maintained.

In the limit of an infinitesimally small amount of traffic for\na particular router, its routing that traffic via an ISPA is optimal, as far as\ncost incurred by that traffic is concerned. We demonstrate though that in many\ncases, due to the side-effects of one router's actions on another routers\nperformance, having routers use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate\ncost is concerned, even when only used to route infinitesimally small amounts\nof traffic. As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess'\nparadox for ISPA's, in which adding new links to a network decreases overall\nthroughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the routing\ndecisions are made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic\ncurrently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across\ntime is concerned. This is also due to \"side-effects\", in this case of current\nrouting decision on future traffic.\n  The theory of COllective INtelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the\nissue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects. We present key concepts from\nthat theory and use them to derive an idealized algorithm whose performance is\nbetter than that of the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present\nexperiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based\nversion of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated (a\nversion potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA,\ndespite having access to less information than does the ISPA.
