The difference from previous calculations is that we use\nmulti-level atoms and evolve the population of each level with redshift by\nincluding all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In this framework we\nfollow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He I, and He II combined.\nThe main improvements of this method over previous recombination calculations\nare: (1) allowing excited atomic level populations to depart from an\nequilibrium distribution; (2) replacing the total recombination coefficient\nwith recombination to and photoionization from each level directly at each\nredshift step; and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the\ntriplet and singlet states. We find that the ionization fraction x_e = n_e/n_H\nis approximately 10% smaller at redshifts <~800 than in previous calculations,\ndue to the non-equilibrium of the excited states of H, which is caused by the\nstrong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition we find that He\nI recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations, and occurs only\njust before H recombination. These changes in turn can affect the predicted\npower spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. Other\nimprovements such as including molecular and ionic species of H, including\ncomplete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature,\nincluding collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary spectral\ndistortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change to x_e. The lower\nx_e at low z found in this work affects the abundances of H molecular and ionic\nspecies by 10-25%. However this difference is probably not larger than other\nuncertainties in the reaction rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 05:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 1999 01:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In\nthis paper we start with a parameterization for the generalized triangle groups\nby three complex numbers. Then we give a matrix representation and introduce an\narithmeticity test for the group in terms of the given parameters. Finally, we\napply the arithmeticity test to prove the finiteness of the number of the\narithmetic groups in a partial case when all three parameters are equal. For\nthis partial case we also describe the parameters of the non cocompact\narithmetic triangle groups and present the singular sets of the corresponding\nfactor-orbifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 14:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
