CI was not detected in several oxygen rich post\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (OH231.8+4.2, for example), although it is\ndetected in their carbon-rich analogues. Two trends are evident in the data.\nFirst, circumstellar envelopes with detectable CI are overwhelmingly carbon\nrich, suggesting that much of the CI is produced by the dissociation of\nmolecules other than CO. Second, the more evolved the envelope away from the\nAGB, the higher is the CI/CO ratio. The oxygen-rich supergiant star Alpha Ori\nremains the only oxygen rich star with a wind containing detectable CI. These\ndata suggest an evolutionary sequence for the CI/CO ratio in cool circumstellar\nenvelopes. This ratio is small (a few %) while the star is on the AGB, and the\nCI is located in the outer envelope and produced by photodissociation. The\nratio increases to about 0.5 as the star evolves away from the AGB because of\nthe dissociation of CO and other carbon-bearing molecules by shocks caused by\nthe fast winds which appear at the end of evolution on the AGB. Finally, the\nratio becomes >> 1 as the central star becomes hot enough to photodissociate\nCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 14:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation\nscaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. The two\nspecies in this model are, on one hand, the ``metallic'' point contacts, whose\ncritical energy lies below the Fermi energy, and on the other hand, the\ninsulating quantum point contacts. It is shown that many features of the\nexperiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on\ntemperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on\ndensity, the $e^2/h$ scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the\nmetallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of\nthe critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally\nexplained by the model.\n  Moreover, details such as the nonmonotonic dependence of the resistance on\ntemperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic are\nalso a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field\ndependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is\nused to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical\ndirection. It is also shown that the resistance on the ``metallic'' side can\ndecrease with decreasing temperature by an arbitrary factor in the degenerate\nregime ($T\\lesssim E_F$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 07:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

On the surface, determining the closest proximity of\ntwo orbital paths appears to be a computationally intensive procedure. This\npaper describes a simple geometric method for determining the proximity between\nthe orbital paths of two bodies (i.e., a comet and a planet) in the solar\nsystem from the known ephemerides of the objects. The method is used to\ndetermine whether or not meteor showers on other planets in the solar system\ncould be associated with any of 250 known comets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 04:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2000 23:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The static radial two-particle distribution function $g(r)$ is\ncalculated for classical ($T \\gtrsim \\hbar \\omega_p$, where $\\omega_p$ is the\nion plasma frequency) and quantum ($T \\ll \\hbar \\omega_p$) body-centered cubic\n(bcc) crystals. The results for the classical crystal are in a very good\nagreement with extensive Monte Carlo (MC) calculations at $1.5 \\lesssim r/a\n\\lesssim 7$, where $a$ is the ion-sphere radius. The HL Coulomb energy is\ncalculated for classical and quantum bcc and face-centered cubic crystals, and\nanharmonic corrections are discussed. The inelastic part of the HL static\nstructure factor $S''(k)$, averaged over orientations of wave-vector {\\bf k},\nis shown to contain pronounced singularities at Bragg diffraction positions.\nThe type of the singularities is different in classical and quantum cases. The\nHL method can serve as a useful tool complementary to MC and other numerical\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 15:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

An example of a system that protects a qubit\nagainst spin-flip errors is proposed. It consists of three spin 1/2 magnetic\nparticles and three modes of a resonator. The qubit is the triple quantum\ncoherence of the spins, and the photons act as ancilla.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 1999 21:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
