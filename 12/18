The redshift distribution of detected clusters will\nconstrain cosmology, while the properties of the discovered clusters will be\nimportant for studies of the ICM and galaxy formation. Estimating survey yields\nrequires a detailed model for both cluster properties and the survey strategy.\nWe address this by making mock observations of galaxy clusters in cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations. The mock observatory consists of an interferometric\narray of ten 2.5 m diameter telescopes, operating at a central frequency of 30\nGHz with a bandwidth of 8 GHz. We find that clusters with a mass above $2.5\n\\times 10^{14} h_{50}^{-1} M_\\odot$ will be detected at any redshift, with the\nexact limit showing a very modest redshift dependence. Using a Press-Schechter\nprescription for evolving the number densities of clusters with redshift, we\ndetermine that such a survey should find hundreds of galaxy clusters per year,\nmany at high redshifts and relatively low mass -- an important regime uniquely\naccessible to SZE surveys.
