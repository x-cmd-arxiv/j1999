A\nproposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation\nfrom a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the\nspin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the\ntime-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from\nsteady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent\nluminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql\nX-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin\nof 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a\nthermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the\nminimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous\nheating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is\nthe case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that\neither the accretion torque is much less than (dM/dt)(GMR)^{1/2}, or that a\nsteady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star\ntransients. Future observations with AXAF and XMM promise to further constrain\nthe amount of viscous dissipation in the neutron star core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 1999 23:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Here, we discuss and model various star-forming\nhistories for IZw 18. Particularly, we show that if the metallicity observed in\nIZw 18 results from starburst events only, the observed colors constrain the\nfraction of the metals ejected from the galaxy to be less than 50-70 %. We\ndemonstrate that the continuous star formation scenario reproduces the observed\nparameters of IZw 18. A continuous star formation rate (SFR) of about 10E-4\nMsol/yr during 14 Gyr reproduces precisely the observed abundances. This SFR is\ncomparable with the lowest SFR observed in low surface brightness galaxies (van\nZee et al. 1997). Generalized to all galaxies, the low continuous SFR scenario\naccounts for various facts: the presence of star formation in quiescent dwarfs\nand LSBG, the metallicity increase with time in the most underabundant DLA\nsystems, and the metal content extrapolations to the outskirts of spiral\ngalaxies. Also the apparent absence of galaxies with a metallicity lower than\nIZw 18, the apparent absence of HI clouds without optical counterparts, and the\nhomogeneity of abundances in dwarfs galaxies are natural outcomes of the\nscenario. This implies that, even if starbursts are strong and important events\nin the life of galaxies, their more subdued but continuous star formation\nregime cannot be ignored when accounting for their chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 1999 23:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The first part of the paper\nconcerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to\nstudy the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity\nbetween the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its\nconfiguration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed,\nwhich sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact,\nit appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was\noriginally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures\nare fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the\ndynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions\nis addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a\nsystem undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the\nconfiguration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase\ntransition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models.\nIn these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature\nfluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration\nspace. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH). The content\nof the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a\nchange in the topology of the configuration space of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 1999 17:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The oblique corrections, the Zqq and Zll vertex\ncorrections, and the vertex and box corrections to the \\mu-decay width are\nseparately studied in detail. We first study individual contribution from the\nfour sectors of the model, the squarks, the sleptons, the supersymmetric\nfermions (charginos and neutralinos), and the supersymmetric Higgs bosons, to\nthe universal oblique parameters, where the sum of individual contributions\ngives the total correction. We find that the light squarks or sleptons, whose\nmasses just above the present direct search limits, always make the fit worse\nthan that of the Standard Model (SM), whereas the light charginos and\nneutralinos generally make the fit slightly better. The contribution from the\nsupersymmetric Higgs sector is found small. We then study the vertex/box\ncorrections carefully when both the supersymmetric fermions (-inos) and the\nsupersymmetric scalars (squarks and sleptons) are light, and find that no\nsignificant improvement over the SM fit is achieved.

The improvement over the SM is marginal, however, where the\ntotal \\chi^2 of the fit to the 22 data points decreases by about one unit, due\nmainly to a slightly better fit to the $Z$-boson total width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 1999 14:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2000 11:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
