This technique yields a gaussian\ndiameter which subsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to\nobtain the true angular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a\nfunction of the FWHM of the beam or point spread function and also depends on\nthe intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the source.\n  In this paper conversion factors are presented for a number of simple\ngeometries: a circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical\nconstant emissivity shell, using a range of values for the inner radius. Also\nmore realistic geometries are studied, based on a spherically symmetric\nphoto-ionization model of a planetary nebula. This enables a study of optical\ndepth effects, a comparison between images in various emission lines and the\nuse of power law density distributions. It is found that the conversion factor\ndepends quite critically on the intrinsic surface brightness distribution,\nwhich is usually unknown. The uncertainty is particularly large if extended\nregions of low surface brightness are present in the nebula. In such cases the\nuse of gaussian or second moment deconvolution is not recommended.\n  As an alternative, a new algorithm is presented which allows the\ndetermination of the intrinsic FWHM of the source using only the observed\nsurface brightness distribution and the FWHM of the beam. Tests show that this\nimplicit deconvolution method works well in realistic conditions, even when the\nsignal-to-noise is low, provided that the beam size is less than roughly 2/3 of\nthe observed FWHM and the beam profile can be approximated by a gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 1999 22:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This would mean that\nergodicity gets broken, but that thermodynamic properties of the liquid remain\nunchanged across the transition if determined as thermodynamic equilibrium\naverages over the whole phase space. The opposite view [3-6] claims that an\nunderlying thermodynamic phase transition is responsible for the dramatic\nslowdown at the liquid-glass boundary. Such a phase transition (which shows up\nin proper equilibrium phase space averages) would trigger the dynamic\nstandstill, and then get masked by it.
