Spikes of a few tens of millisecond duration occur at\ndecimetric/microwave wavelength in the particle acceleration phase of solar\nflares. A first method determines the dominant spike bandwidth scale based on\ntheir scalegram, the mean squared wavelet coefficient at each frequency scale.\nThis allows to measure the scale bandwidth independently of heuristic spike\nselection criteria, e.g. manual selection. The major drawback is a low\nresolution in the bandwidth. To overcome this uncertainty, a feature detection\nalgorithm and a criterion for spike shape in the time-frequency plane is\napplied to locate the spikes. In that case, the bandwidth is measured by\nfitting an assumed spike profile into the denoised data. The smallest FWHM\nbandwidth of spikes was found at 0.17 % and 0.41 % of the center frequency in\nthe two events. Knowing the shortest relevant bandwidth of spikes, the slope of\nthe Fourier power spectrum of this two events was determined and no resemblance\nto a Kolmogorov spectrum detected.

The CO morphology is dominated by a\ncentral molecular bar and tightly wound spiral arms associated with a bright\nring of star formation. Strong HI emission is also found in the ring, but HI is\nabsent from the central regions. Comparison of the HI and Halpha distributions\nsuggests that HI in the ring is primarily dissociated H$_2$. Modeling of the CO\nkinematics reveals gas motion in elliptical orbits around the central bar, and\nwe argue that the ring represents both the OLR of the bar and the ILR of a\nlarger oval distortion. The HI kinematics show evidence for axisymmetric inflow\ntowards the ring and are inconsistent with streaming in aligned elliptical\norbits, but the highly supersonic (~40 km/s) inflow velocities required,\ncorresponding to mass inflow rates of ~2 Msol/yr, suggest that more\nsophisticated models (e.g., gas orbiting in precessed elliptical orbits) should\nbe considered. The radial CO and Halpha profiles are poorly correlated in the\nvicinity of the nuclear bar, but show a better correlation (in rough agreement\nwith the Schmidt law) at the ring. Even along the ring, however, the azimuthal\ncorrespondence between CO and Halpha is poor, suggesting that massive stars\nform more efficiently at some (perhaps resonant) locations than at others.\nThese results indicate that the star formation rate per unit gas mass exhibits\nstrong spatial variations and is not solely a function of the available gas\nsupply. The localization of star formation to the ring is broadly consistent\nwith gravitational instability theory, although the instability parameter $Q\n\\sim 3$ on average in the ring, only falling below 1 in localized regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 19:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2000 18:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this paper, we show that the bi-infinite\nsequence obtained by Darboux transforming an arbitrary KP solution recursively\nforward and backwards, yields a solution to the discrete KP-hierarchy. The\nlatter is a KP hierarchy where the continuous space x-variable gets replaced by\na discrete n-variable. The fact that these sequences satisfy the discrete KP\nhierarchy is tantamount to certain bilinear relations connecting the\nconsecutive KP solutions in the sequence. At the Grassmannian level, these\nrelations are equivalent to a very simple fact, which is the nesting of the\nassociated infinite-dimensional planes (flag).\n  It turns out that many new and old systems lead to such discrete\n(semi-infinite) solutions, like sequences of soliton solutions, with more and\nmore solitons, sequences of Calogero-Moser systems, having more and more\nparticles, band matrices, etc... ; this will be developped in another paper. In\nthis paper, as an other example, we show that the q-KP hierarchy maps, via a\nkind of Fourier transform, into the discrete KP hierarchy, enabling us to write\ndown a very large class of solutions to the q-KP hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 18:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
