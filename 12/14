The basic tenet of the method is that\nthe planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar\nflux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb.\nThe ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is\nsmall, approximately 10^{-3} to 10^{-4}; for this method to work very strong\nplanet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in\nextrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the\nalkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I resonance doublets, and the\nHe I $2^3S$ - $2^3P$ triplet line at 1083.0 nm.

The damping rate $\\Gamma_{q}$ is\ncalculated using the leading diagrams due to the quartic-order deviations from\nthe harmonic spin Hamiltonian. The resulting four-dimensional integrals are\nevaluated by extending the techniques developed by Gilat and others for\nspectral density types of integrals. $\\Gamma_{q}$ is included into the memory\nfunction formalism due to Reiter and Solander, and Menezes, to determine the\ndynamic structure function $S(q,\\omega)$. For the infinite sized system, the\nmemory function approach is found to give non-divergent spinwave peaks, and a\nsmooth nonzero background intensity (``plateau'' or distributed intensity) for\nthe whole range of frequencies below the spinwave peak. The background\namplitude relative to the spinwave peak rises with temperature, and eventually\nbecomes higher than the spinwave peak, where it appears as a central peak. For\nfinite-sized systems, there are multiple sequences of weak peaks on both sides\nof the spinwave peaks whose number and positions depend on the system size and\nwavevector in integer units of $2\\pi/L$. These dynamical finite size effects\nare explained in the memory function analysis as due to either spinwave\ndifference processes below the spinwave peak or sum processes above the\nspinwave peak.

A generalized gradient approximation (GGA) takes the strong\ninhomogeneities of the electron density in the ion core region into account and\nreproduces well the experimental total annihilation rates (inverses of the\npositron lifetimes) by suppressing the rates given by a local density\napproximation (LDA).

It is\nshown that the crucial physical principles of gauge-invariance, unitarity, and\ngauge-fixing-parameter independence single out at two loops exactly the same\nalgorithm which has been used to define the pinch technique at one loop,\nwithout any additional assumptions. The two-loop construction of the pinch\ntechnique gluon self-energy, and quark-gluon vertex are carried out in detail\nfor the case of mass-less Yang-Mills theories, such as perturbative QCD. We\npresent two different but complementary derivations. First we carry out the\nconstruction by directly rearranging two-loop diagrams. The analysis reveals\nthat, quite interestingly, the well-known one-loop correspondence between the\npinch technique and the background field method in the Feynman gauge persists\nalso at two-loops. The renormalization is discussed in detail, and is shown to\nrespect the aforementioned correspondence. Second, we present an absorptive\nderivation, exploiting the unitarity of the $S$-matrix and the underlying BRS\nsymmetry; at this stage we deal only with tree-level and one-loop physical\namplitudes. The gauge-invariant sub-amplitudes defined by means of this\nabsorptive construction correspond precisely to the imaginary parts of the\n$n$-point functions defined in the full two-loop derivation, thus furnishing a\nhighly non-trivial self-consistency check for the entire method.

Given a reductive\ngroup G, let I be the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram of G and T be the\nmaximal torus of G. The structure of a geometric G-crystal on an algebraic\nvariety X consists of a rational morphism \\gamma:X-->T and a compatible family\ne_i:G_m\\times X-->X, i\\in I of rational actions of the multiplicative group G_m\nsatisfying certain braid-like relations. Such a structure induces a rational\naction of W on X. Quite surprisingly, many interesting rational actions of the\ngroup W come from geometric crystals. Also all the known examples of the action\nof W which appear in the construction of gamma-functions for the\nrepresentations of ^LG in the recent work by A. Braverman and D. Kazhdan come\nfrom geometric crystals. There are many examples of positive geometric crystals\non (G_m)^l, i.e., those geometric crystals for which the actions e_i and the\nmorphism \\gamma are given by positive rational expressions. To each positive\ngeometric crystal X we associate a Kashiwara's crystal corresponding to the\nLanglands dual group ^LG. An emergence of ^LG in the \"crystal world\" was\nobserved earlier by G.

It is demonstrated that in the\nperipheral heavy-ion collisions the high-momentum elliptic flow is strongly\nsensitive to the momentum dependence of mean field at supranormal densities.\nThe high transverse-momentum particles are directly and exclusively emitted\nfrom the high-density zone in the collisions, while remaining particles\nprimarily continue along the beam axis. The elliptic flow was measured by the\nKaoS Collaboration as a function of the transverse momentum at a number of\nimpact parameters in Bi + Bi collisions at 400, 700, and 1000 MeV/nucleon. The\nobserved elliptic anisotropies in peripheral collisions, which quickly rise\nwith momentum, can only be explained in simulations when assuming a strong\nmomentum dependence of nucleonic mean field.

The mean-field\nparametrizations, which describe the data in simulations with various success,\nare confronted with mean fields from microscopic nuclear-matter calculations.\nTwo of the microscopic potentials in the comparisons have unacceptably weak\nmomentum-dependencies at supranormal densities.
