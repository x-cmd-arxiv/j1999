A common theme is the role of rotation and magnetic fields. A\nrigorous examination is underway to characterize systematic effects that might\nalter the Type Ia supernova results suggesting an accelerating Universe. The\ndiscovery of the central point of X-ray emission in Cas A by CXO should give\nnew insight into the core collapse problem in general and the nature of the\nstill undetected compact remnant in SN 1987A in particular. Jets were described\nfrom protostars to microquasars to blazars to gamma-ray bursts. Polarization\nstudies of core-collapse supernovae lead to the conclusion that core collapse\nis not merely asymmetric, but strongly bi-polar. To account for normal\ncore-collapse supernovae, the explosion must be jet-like in routine\ncircumstances, that is, in the formation of neutron stars, not only for black\nholes. Given the observed asymmetries, estimates of explosion energies based on\nspherically-symmetric models must be regarded with caution.

Therefore, when V carries a real or quaternionic\nstructure, it is natural to ask for the properties of the groups of real or\nquaternionic algebraic cycles on P(V). In this paper and its sequel the\nhomotopy structure of these cycle groups is determined. They bear a direct\nrelationship to characteristic classes for the classical groups, and functors\nin K-theory extend directly to these groups. These groups give rise to\nE-infinity-ring spaces, and the maps extending the K-theory functors are ring\nmaps. The stabilized space of cycles is a product of (Z/2Z)-equivariant\nEilenberg-MacLane spaces indexed by the representations R^{n,n} for n > 0. This\ngives a wide generalization of the results in Boyer, Lawson, Lima-Filho, Mann\nand Michelsohn on the Segal question. The ring structure on the homotopy groups\nof these stabilized spaces is explicitly computed. In the real case it is a\nquotient of a polynomial algebra on two generators corresponding to the first\nPontrjagin and first Stiefel-Whitney classes. This yields an interesting total\ncharacteristic class for real bundles. It is a mixture of integral and mod 2\nclasses and has nice multiplicative properties.
