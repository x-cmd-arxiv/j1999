On 1996 June 18, in the midst of this intensive monitoring\nperiod, we obtained a high signal-to-noise snapshot of the UV spectrum from\n1150-3300 A using the FOS on HST. This spectrum allows us to disentangle the UV\ncontinuum more accurately from the broad wings of the emission lines, to\nidentify clean continuum windows free of contaminating emission and absorption,\nand to deblend line complexes such as Lya+NV, CIV+HeII+OIII], SiIII]+CIII], and\nMgII+FeII. Using the FOS spectrum as a template, we have fit and extracted line\nand continuum fluxes from the IUE monitoring data. The cleaner continuum\nextractions confirm the discovery of time delays between the different UV\ncontinuum bands by Wanders et al. Our new measurements show delays increasing\nwith wavelength for continuum bands centered at 1485 A, 1740 A and 1825 A\nrelative to 1315 A with delays of 0.09, 0.28 and 0.36 days, respectively.

Similar to other Seyfert galaxies such as\nNGC 3516, the UV-absorbing gas in NGC 7469 has a lower ionization parameter and\ncolumn density than the X-ray absorbing material. While the UV and X-ray\nabsorption does not arise in the same material, the frequent occurrence of both\nassociated UV absorption and X-ray warm absorbers in the same galaxies suggests\nthat the gas supply for each has a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 22:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The large-scale\nstructure that exists in the Universe indicates that the bulk of the\nnonbaryonic dark matter must be cold (slowly moving particles). The\nSuperKamiokande detection of neutrino oscillations shows that particle dark\nmatter exists, crossing an important threshold. Over the past few years a case\nhas developed for a dark-energy problem. This dark component contributes about\n80% +/- 20% of the critical density and is characterized by very negative\npressure (p_X < -0.6 rho_X). Consistent with this picture of dark energy and\ndark matter are measurements of CMB anisotropy that indicate that total\ncontribution of matter and energy is within 10% of the critical density.\nFundamental physics beyond the standard model is implicated in both the dark\nmatter and dark energy puzzles: new fundamental particles (e.g., axion or\nneutralino) and new forms of relativistic energy (e.g., vacuum energy or a\nlight scalar field). A flood of observations will shed light on the dark side\nof the Universe over the next two decades; as it does it will advance our\nunderstanding of the Universe and the laws of physics that govern it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 22:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The form of the lateral distribution of charged particles agrees well\nwith the experimental one between a few hundred metres and 2000 m from the\ncore, irrespective of the hadronic interaction model studied and the primary\ncomposition (proton or iron).

The present paper is devoted to aperture photometry. We discuss\nnuclear (within the central 2 kpc) and disk optical properties and their\ncorrelations with IR properties. We find a transition in the observed optical\nand IR properties from the Cold to the Warm Seyfert 2 and Seyfert 1 samples,\nwith a partial overlap between the first two. This is in the sense of: (i)\nincreasing nuclear optical luminosities and bluer nuclear colours (ii)\ndecreasing disk optical luminosities and sizes (iii) increasing 25 micron\nluminosities, decreasing far-IR excess L(IR)/L(B) and IR-loudness a(V,25) or\na(V,60) and bluer a(25,60) and a(12,100) colours. We interpret these results as\nindicating larger dust content, and disk star formation for Seyfert 2s, while\nthe optical properties of Seyfert 1s are mostly dominated by their nuclei. The\n25 micron emission of the Warm sample is mainly due to the AGN thermal\ncomponent, although in Seyfert 2s it is probably further enhanced by disk star\nformation. Their far-IR (60-100 micron) luminosity on the other hand, traces\nmainly emission at large scales (host disks). In the Cold galaxies, the bulk of\nIR emission at all wavelengths appears to be dominated by dust in their disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 1999 15:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Each\nof these components has a different spectral index so that the total radio\nspectral index of a galaxy depends sensitively on their relative contribution\nand on the processes shaping the diffuse synchrotron emission. In the present\npaper we calculate the contribution of supernova remnants to the total\nsynchrotron emission and conclude that it is about 10%. This moderate\ncontribution has a noticeable effect on the nonthermal spectral index, lowering\nit by $\\simeq 0.1$ for steep spectra. We then calculate the diffuse synchrotron\nemission in two simple models, a diffusion and a convection model. We find that\nthe spatially integrated nonthermal spectral index is in general a poor\ndiagnostic for the type of propagation or the importance of energy losses.\nSpatially resolved radio data for the halo of galaxies are necessary in order\nto draw firm conclusions. The steepening of the spectrum away from the disk is\na clear indication that synchrotron and inverse Compton losses are taking place\nduring the propagation of cosmic ray electrons in the halo. In those galaxies\nfor which spatially resolved data for the halos exist such a steepening has\nbeen found.

As our one-dimensional\nmodel system we choose the silver mean or `octonacci' chain. The\ntwo-dimensional labyrinth tiling, which is related to the octagonal tiling, is\nderived from a product of two octonacci chains. This makes it possible to treat\nrather large systems numerically. For the octonacci chain, one finds singular\ncontinuous energy spectra and critical eigenstates which is the typical\nbehaviour for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators based on substitution\nsequences. The energy spectra for the labyrinth tiling can, depending on the\nstrength of the quasiperiodic modulation, be either band-like or fractal-like.\nHowever, the eigenstates are multifractal. The temporal spreading of a\nwavepacket is described in terms of the autocorrelation function C(t) and the\nmean square displacement d(t).

Although these are generally well determined in the small and\nmedium x range, it has been shown that their uncertainty grows rapidly for x >\n0.1. We examine the status of the gluon and quark distributions in light of new\nquestions that have been raised in the past two years about large-x parton\ndistributions, as well as recent measurements which have improved the parton\nuncertainties. We perform several specific global fits to answer the\noutstanding questions, and to investigate the potential of future experiments,\nparticularly at HERA, which may provide critical constraints on parton\ndistributions at large x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1999 20:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

According to this result, the thermal\nfluctuations can induce a voltage with direct component in a inhomogeneous\nsuperconducting ring at an unaltered temperature corresponded to the resistive\ntransition of the ring segment with the lowest critical temperature. This\nresult arises from obvious statements: 1) the switching of a ring segment\n$l_{b}$ into and out of the normal state, while the rest of the ring (segment\n$l_{a}$) remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc component (It\nis shown that, in spite of the wide spread opinion, this statement is correct\nbecause the superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomena); 2) the\nthermal fluctuations switch the mesoscopic ring segment $l_{b}$ with lowest\ncritical temperature $T_{sb}$ into and out of the normal state at $T \\simeq\nT_{sb}$, while the rest of the ring remains superconducting if $T_{sa} > T\n\\simeq T_{sb}$.

The possibilities of writing and reading two quantum bits of\ninformation, preparation of the initial state, implementation of the \"rotation\"\nand \"controlled negation\" operations, which are sufficient for constructing any\nalgorithms, are demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 1999 12:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
