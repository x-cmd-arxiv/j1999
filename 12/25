Second, we find that, when clusters have\ntwo components in their surface brightness distribution, the inner components\nalso satisfy the same fundamental relations on the assumption that the average\ntemperature of the inner component is the same as that of the outer component.\nThese results strengthen our interpretation that clusters form a two parameter\nfamily in terms of mass and rho_vir; larger rho_vir corresponds to earlier\nformation epoch. We argue that the inner components represent distinct dark\nmatter components which collapsed ahead of the outer components. Third, we also\nfind a tight relation between S_gas and rho_vir both for the outer and inner\ncomponents; S_gas is smaller for larger rho_vir but is larger than that\nproduced through gravitational collapse alone for larger rho_vir. Although\nradiative cooling affects the thermal evolution, the tight relationship\ndiscovered suggests the existence of stable heating sources or stable energy\ntransmission mechanisms.

The\nlatter are identified through nuclear collective excitations of `meson'-sobar\ntype such as $\\pi\\leftrightarrow [\\Delta (1232)N^{-1}]\\equiv\\hat\\pi$,\n$\\rho\\leftrightarrow [N^* (1520)N^{-1}]\\equiv\\hat\\rho$, etc.. In a mean-field\ntype treatment the in-medium gauge coupling $\\hat g$, the (axial-) vector meson\nmasses and $\\hat f_\\pi$ are found to decrease with density indicating the\napproach towards chiral restoration in the language of in-medium effective\nfields. In the second part of our analysis we evaluate the (first) in-medium\nWeinberg sum rule which relates vector and axialvector correlators to the pion\ndecay constant. Using in-medium $\\rho$/$a_1$ spectral functions (computed in\nthe two-level model) also leads to a substantial reduction of the pion decay\nconstant with increasing density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 1999 22:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2000 02:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The theory gives two types of bubble behavior: collapse\nand viscous damping. This results in a general collapse condition proposed as\nthe sufficient differential criterion. The suggested criterion is discussed and\nsuccessfully applied to the analysis of the void and gas bubble collapses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 1999 18:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
