From those observations, we infer that jets\nin quasars contain many more electron - positron pairs than protons, but\ndynamically are still dominated by protons. In particular, we show that pure\nelectron - positron jet models can be excluded, as they overpredict soft X-ray\nradiation; likewise, pure proton - electron jets can be excluded, as they\npredict too weak nonthermal X-ray radiation. An intermediate case is viable. We\ndemonstrate that jets which are initially proton-electron (\"proto-jets\") can be\npair-loaded via interaction with 100 - 300 keV photons produced in hot\naccretion disc coronae, likely to exist in active galactic nuclei in general.\nIf the coronal radiation is powered by magnetic flares, the pair loading is\nexpected to be non-uniform and non-axisymmetric. Together with radiation drag,\nthis leads to velocity and density perturbations in a jet and formation of\nshocks, where the pairs are accelerated. Such a scenario can explain rapid\n(time scale of about a day) variability observed in OVV quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 1999 00:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The code, named COSMOS, possesses several\nnew features which distinguish it from other PM-PPM codes. In particular, to\nsolve the Poisson equation we have written a new multigrid solver which can\ndetermine the gravitational potential of isolated matter distributions and\nwhich properly takes into account the finite-volume discretization required by\nPPM.

It is therefore very\nuseful to provide various consistency criteria which have to be satisfied by\nthis quantity, whose discussion is the main objective of this contribution. We\nshow how the scaling behaviour of the space leads to a symmetry in the\nionization probability, which can be exploited in the mentioned sense.\nFurthermore, we discuss how upper and lower bounds may be used for the same\npurpose. Rather than concentrating on particular analytical expressions we\nobtained elsewhere for these bounds, we focus in our discussion on the general\nprinciples of this method. We illustrate the precise working of this procedure,\nits advantages, shortcomings and range of applicability. We show that besides\nconstraining possible values for the ionization probability these bounds, like\nthe scaling behaviour, also lead to definite statements concerning the physical\noutcome.
