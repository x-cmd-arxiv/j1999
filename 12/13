The model includes a\nreflection effect by the companion and the accretion disk together with a\nshadowing effect on the companion by the accretion disk. The early visual light\ncurve (t ~ 1-15 days after maximum) is well reproduced by a thermonuclear\nrunaway model on a very massive WD close to the Chandrasekhar limit (M_{WD}=\n1.37 \\pm 0.01 M_\\odot), in which optically thick winds blowing from the WD play\na key role in determining the nova duration. The duration of the strong wind\nphase (t~0-17 days) is very consistent with the BeppoSAX supersoft X-ray\ndetection at t~19-20 days because supersoft X-rays are self-absorbed by the\nmassive wind.

(1) The alpha-nuclei (from C to Zn) are more efficiently produced\nthan other isotopes, and the abundance pattern of alpha-nuclei can be similar\nto the solar abundance. In particular, near solar ratios of alpha elements/Fe\nmight be a signature of Pop III which could produce a large amount of Fe.

In this way, the\ncluster-separated limits are exact, and the Lorentz invariance / cluster\nseparability requirement is automatically satisfied, provided no supplementary\napproximation, like the Born approximation, is made. The use of positive\nfree-energy projectors in the chosen reductions of the two-fermion\nBethe-Salpeter equations prevents continuum dissolution in our 3D three-fermion\nequation. The potentials are hermitian below the inelastic threshold and depend\nonly slowly on the total three-fermion energy. This \"hand-made\" three-fermion\n3D equation is also obtained by starting with an approximation of the\nthree-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation, in which the three-body kernel is\nneglected and the two-body kernels approached by positive-energy instantaneous\nexpressions, with the spectator fermion on the mass shell. The neglected terms\nare then transformed into corrections to the 3D equation, in three steps\nimplying each a series expansion. The result is of course complicated, but the\nlowest-order contributions of these correction terms to the energy spectrum\nremain manageable.We also present some other 3D reduction procedures and\ncompare them to our's: use of Sazdjian's covariant approximation of the free\npropagator, 3D reductions performed by a series expansion around instantaneous\napproximations of the kernels instead of \"approximations\" of the propagators,\nGross' spectator model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 1999 09:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
