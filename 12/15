Superimposing a perturbative ensemble of\nzero momentum gauge field fluctuations (torons) on the instantons is found to\nbe enough to eliminate the free quarks and restore the physical hadron\ncorrelators. I argue that the torons that are present only in finite volumes,\nare probably needed to compensate the unnaturally large finite size effects due\nto the lack of confinement in the instanton ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 1999 20:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
