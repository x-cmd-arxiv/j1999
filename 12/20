We also\nstudy the large-$L$ behavior of the susceptibility $\\chi$ of the confined\nlattice system of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. The large-$L$\nbehavior of $\\chi$ is closely related to the large-$r$ behavior of $G(\\bf{r})$.\nExplicit results are derived for $d>2$. Finite-size scaling must be formulated\nin terms of the anisotropic exponential correlation length $\\xi_1$ that governs\nthe decay of $G(\\bf{r})$ for large $r$ rather than in terms of the isotropic\ncorrelation length $\\xi$ defined via the second moment of $G(\\bf{r})$. This\nresult modifies a recent interpretation concerning an apparent violation of\nfinite-size scaling in terms of $\\xi \\neq \\xi_1$. Exact results for the $d=1$\nIsing model illustrate our conclusions. Furthermore, we show that the\nexponential finite-size behavior for $L/\\xi\\gg 1$ is not captured by the\nstandard perturbation approach that separates the lowest mode from the higher\nmodes. Consequences for the theory of finite-size effects for $d>4$ are\ndiscussed. The two-variable finite-size scaling form predicts an approach\n$\\propto e^{-L/\\xi_1}$ to the bulk critical behavior whereas a single-variable\nscaling form implies a power-law approach $\\propto L^{-d}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 1999 15:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This example shows that traditional homological algebra is\nencompassed by Quillen's homotopical algebra. The goal of this paper is to show\nthat more general forms of homological algebra also fit into Quillen's\nframework. Specifically, any set of objects in a complete and cocomplete\nabelian category A generates a projective class on A, which is exactly the\ninformation needed to do homological algebra in A. The main result is that if\nthe generating objects are ``small'' in an appropriate sense, then the category\nof chain complexes of objects of A has a model category structure which\nreflects the homological algebra of the projective class. The motivation for\nthis work is the construction of the ``pure derived category'' of a ring R.\nFinally, we explain how the category of simplicial objects in a possibly\nnon-abelian category can be equipped with a model category structure reflecting\na given projective class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 1999 04:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 22:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
