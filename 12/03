In particular, the concept of tracking\nsolutions permits to adress the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. We study\nthis proposal in the simplest case of an inverse power potential and\ninvestigate its robustness to corrections. We show that quintessence is not\naffected by the one-loop quantum corrections. In the supersymmetric case where\nthe quintessential potential is motivated by non-perturbative effects in gauge\ntheories, we consider the curvature effects and the K\\\"ahler corrections. We\nfind that the curvature effects are negligible while the K\\\"ahler corrections\nmodify the early evolution of the quintessence field. Finally we study the\nsupergravity corrections and show that they must be taken into account as\n$Q\\approx m_{\\rm Pl}$ at small red-shifts. We discuss simple supergravity\nmodels exhibiting the quintessential behaviour. In particular, we propose a\nmodel where the scalar potential is given by $V(Q)=\\frac{\\Lambda^{4+\\alpha\n}}{Q^{\\alpha}}e^{\\frac{\\kappa}{2}Q^2}$.

The protocol relies on a local\nquantum non-demolition measurement of the total excitation number of several\ncontinuous variable entangled pairs. We propose an optical scheme to do this\nkind of measurement using cavity enhanced cross--Kerr interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 1999 14:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2000 09:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
