However,\nif the hot interior gas becomes dense enough due to evaporation or ablation off\nof interior clouds, it will cool in less than a dynamical time, leading to a\ncold interior. The observational evidence appears mixed. On the one hand, X-ray\nemission has been observed from both stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles. On\nthe other hand, no stellar wind bubble or superbubble has yet been observed\nemitting at the rate predicted by the classical theory: they are either too\nfaint or too bright, by up to an order of magnitude.

When applied to\npoint-charge sources (viewed as limiting cases of charged fluids) the resulting\nnonlinear weakly hyperbolic system lies beyond the scope of classical\ndistribution theory. Using regularized derivatives in the framework of\nColombeau algebras of generalized functions we analyze a two-dimensional\nanalogue of the Maxwell-Lorentz system. After establishing existence and\nuniqueness of solutions in this setting we derive some results on\ndistributional limits of solutions with $\\delta$-like initial values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 1999 08:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A\nwide subcategory of R-modules is an Abelian subcategory of R-Mod that is closed\nunder extensions. We give a complete classification of wide subcategories of\nfinitely presented modules when R is a quotient of a regular commutative\ncoherent ring by a finitely generated ideal. This includes all finitely\npresented algebras over a principal ideal domain, as well as polynomial rings\non infinitely many variable over a PID. The classification is in terms of\nsubsets of Spec R, and depends heavily on Thomason's classification of thick\nsubcategories of small objects in the derived category.\n  We also classify all wide subcategories closed under arbitrary coproducts for\nany Noetherian commutative ring R. These correspond to arbitrary subsets of\nSpec R, and this classification depends on Neeman's classification of\nlocalizing subcategories of the derived category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 1999 15:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
