To remedy this\nfailing, there has been widespread interest recently in reformulating\nEinstein's theory as a hyperbolic system of differential equations. The\nphysical and geometrical content of the original theory remain unchanged, but\ndynamical evolution is made sound. Here we present a new hyperbolic formulation\nin terms of $g_{ij}$, $K_{ij}$, and $\\bGam_{kij}$ that is strikingly close to\nthe space-plus-time (``3+1'') form of Einstein's original equations.
