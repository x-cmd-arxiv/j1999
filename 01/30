Our goal in studying these stars is to investigate the properties\nof the cirrus clouds. A comparison of the observed stellar surface density\nbetween on-cloud and off-cloud regions as a function of apparent magnitude in\neach of the five bands effectively yields a measure of the extinction through\neach cloud. For two of the cirrus clouds, this method is used to derive UBVRI\nstar counts-based extinction curves, and U-band counts are used to place\nconstraints on the cloud distance. The color distribution of stars and their\nlocation in (U-B, B-V) and (B-V, V-I) color-color space are analyzed in order\nto determine the amount of selective extinction (reddening) caused by the\ncirrus. The color excesses, A_lambda-A_V, derived from stellar color histogram\noffsets for the four clouds, are better fit by a reddening law that rises\nsteeply towards short wavelengths [R_V==A_V/E(B-V)<=2] than by the standard law\n(R_V=3.1).

The answer is, in a sense to be made precise,\nthat a multicategory of one type can be enriched in a multicategory of the type\none level up.\n  In the case of ordinary categories this reduces to something surprising: a\ncategory may be enriched in an `fc-multicategory', a very general kind of\n2-dimensional structure encompassing monoidal categories, plain\nmulticategories, bicategories and double categories. (It turns out that\nfc-multicategories also provide a natural setting for the bimodules\nconstruction.) An extended application is given: the relaxed multicategories of\nBorcherds and Soibelman are explained in terms of enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 1999 18:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that the\ninterplay between the Coulomb interaction and the strong interaction, which is\nenhanced in the nuclear surface, leads to an upward shift of the proton\nsingle--particle levels. This shift affects the position of the calculated\nproton drip line, a shift towards decreasing $Z$. We describe briefly a similar\nmechanism which is at work for neutron levels. The same mechanism is\nresponsible for significant corrections to the mass difference of the mirror\nnuclei (Nolen--Schiffer anomaly) and to the effective proton mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 1999 01:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 1999 02:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-21"}

We use the influence functional method which can\nincorporate the full backreaction of the field on the atom, while adopting\nGrassmannian variables for the 2LA and the coherent state representation for\nthe EMF. We find exact master equations for the cases of a free quantum field\nand a cavity field in the vacuum. In response to the search for mechanisms to\npreserve maximal coherence in quantum computations in ion trap prototypes, we\napply these equations to analyse the decoherence of a 2LA in an EMF, and fine\nthat decoherence time is close to relaxation time. This is at variance to the\nclaims by authors who studied the same system but used a different coupling\nmodel. We explain the source of difference and argue that, contrary to common\nbelief, the EMF when resonantly coupled to an atom does not decohere it as\nefficiently as a bath does on a quantum Brownian particle. The master-equations\nfor non-Markovian dynamics derived here is expected to be useful for exploring\nnew regimes of 2LA-EMF interaction, which is becoming physically important\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 1999 01:09:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 1999 17:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2000 18:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}
