All calculations in books describe oscillations in time. But\nreal experiments don't measure time. Hand waving is used to convert the results\nof a \"gedanken time experiment\" to the result of a real experiment measuring\noscillations in space. Right hand waving gives the right answer; wrong hand\nwaving gives the wrong answer. Many papers use wrong handwaving to get wrong\nanswers. This talk explains how to do it right and also answers the following\nquestions:\n  1. A neutrino which is a mixture of two mass eigenstates is emitted with muon\nin the decay of a pion at rest. This is a a \"missing mass experiment\" where the\nmuon energy determines the neutrino mass. Why are the two mass states coherent?\n  2. A neutrino which is a mixture of two mass eigenstates is emitted at time\nt=0. The two mass eigenstates move with different velocities and arrive at the\ndetector at different times. Why are the two mass states coherent?\n  3. A neutrino is a mixture of two overlapping wave packets with different\nmasses moving with different velocities. Will the wave packets eventually\nseparate? If yes, when?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 1999 10:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
