This\nfeature is made of stars just massive enough for having ignited helium in\nnon-degenerate conditions. In this paper, we go into more details about the\norigin and properties of this feature. We first compare the clump theoretical\nmodels with data for clusters of different ages and metallicities, basically\nconfirming the predicted behaviours. We then refine the previous models in\norder to show that: (i) The faint extension is expected to be clearly separated\nfrom the main clump in the CMD of metal-rich populations, defining a secondary\nclump by itself. (ii) It should be present in all galactic fields containing ~1\nGyr old stars and with mean metallicities higher than about Z=0.004. (iii) It\nshould be particularly strong, if compared to the main red clump, in galaxies\nwhich have increased their star formation rate in the last Gyr or so of their\nevolution. In fact, secondary clumps similar to the model predictions are\nobserved in the CMD of nearby stars from Hipparcos data, and in those of some\nLMC fields observed to date. There are also several reasons why this secondary\nclump may be missing or hidden in other observed CMDs of galaxy fields (e.g.\nphotometric errors or differential absorption larger than 0.2 mag).\nNonetheless, this structure may provide important constraints to the star\nformation history of Local Group galaxies. We comment also on the intrinsic\nluminosity variation and dispersion of clump stars, which may limit their use\nas either absolute or relative distance indicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 1999 10:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Such relations are needed for QCD sum rules. We\npoint out the importance of scattering terms, as well as finite, well-defined\nsubtraction constants. Both are necessary for consistency, in particular for\nthe equality of the longitudinal and transverse correlators in the limit of the\nvanishing three-momentum of mesons relative to the medium. We present detailed\ncalculations in various mesonic channels for the case of the Fermi gas of\nnucleons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 1999 10:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We generalize the Liouville equation\njust by requiring the dynamical semigroup property of time evolution and\ndropping the unitarity requirement. With no approximations and statistical\nassumptions we find a generalized Liouville equation which depends on two\ncharacteristic time t1 and t2 and reduces to the usual equation in the limit t1\n= t2 -> 0. However, for t1 and t2 arbitrarily small but finite, our equation\ncan be written as a finite difference equation which predicts state reduction\nto the diagonal form in the energy representation. The rate of decoherence\nbecomes faster at the macroscopic limit as the energy scale of the system\nincreases. In our approach the evolution time appears, a posteriori, as a\nstatistical variable with a Poisson-gamma function probability distribution as\nif time evolution would take place randomly at average intervals t2 each\nevolution having a time width t1.
