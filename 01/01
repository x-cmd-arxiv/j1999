We show a simple model to explain the momentum distribution of the\natoms taken after any distinct number of modulation cycles. The peaks\ncorresponding to a classical resonance move towards smaller velocities in\ncomparison to the velocities of the classical resonances. We explain this by\nshowing that, for a wave packet on the classical resonances, we can replace the\ncomplicated dynamics in the quantum Liouville equation in phase-space by the\nclassical dynamics in a modified potential. Therefore we can describe the\nquantum mechanical motion of a wave packet on a classical resonance by a purely\nclassical motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 1999 09:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
