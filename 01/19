Theoretical modelling is based on an improved\nscheme for treating the third dredge-up in synthetic calculations of thermally\npulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars. In this approach, the usual\ncriterion (based on a constant minimum core mass for the occurrence of\ndredge-up, M_c^min) is replaced by one on the minimum temperature at the base\nof the convective envelope, T_b^dred, at the stage of the post-flash luminosity\nmaximum. Envelope integrations then allow determination of M_c^min as a\nfunction of stellar mass, metallicity, and pulse strength (see Wood 1981), thus\ninferring if and when dredge-up first occurs. Moreover, the final possible shut\ndown of the process is predicted. Extensive grids of TP-AGB models were\ncomputed using this scheme. We present and discuss the calibration of the two\ndredge-up parameters (lambda and T_b^dred) aimed at reproducing the carbon star\nluminosity function (CSLF) in the LMC. It turns out that the faint tail is\nalmost insensitive to the history of star formation rate (SFR) in the parent\ngalaxy (it is essentially determined by T_b^dred), in contrast to the bright\nwing which may be more affected by the details of the recent SFR. Once the\nfaint end is reproduced, the peak location is a stringent calibrator of lambda.\nThe best fit to the observed CSLF in the LMC is obtained with Z=0.008,\nlambda=0.50, log(T_b^dred)=6.4, and a constant SFR up to 5x10^8 yr ago. A good\nfit to the CSLF in the SMC is then easily derived from the Z=0.004 models, with\na single choice of parameters, and a constant SFR over the entire significant\nage interval. The results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that\nthe third dredge-up is more efficient at lower Zs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 1999 17:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

Suprathermally rotating\ngrains would be nearly perfectly aligned with the magnetic field by\nparamagnetic dissipation if not for ``crossovers'', intervals of low angular\nvelocity resulting from reversals of the torques responsible for suprathermal\nrotation; during crossovers grains are susceptible to disalignment by random\nimpulses.\n  Lazarian and Draine (1997) identified thermal fluctuations within grain\nmaterial as an important component of crossover dynamics. For grains of size\nless than 0.1 micron, these fluctuations ensure good correlation of angular\nmomentum before and after crossover resulting in good alignment, in accord with\nobservations of starlight polarization. In the present paper we discuss two new\nprocesses which are important for the dynamics of grains with a<0.1 micron. The\nfirst -- ``thermal flipping'' -- offers a way for small grains to bypass the\nperiod of greatly reduced angular momentum which would otherwise take place\nduring a crossover, thereby enhancing the alignment of small grains. The second\neffect -- ``thermal trapping'' -- arises when thermal flipping becomes rapid\nenough to prevent the systematic torques from driving the grain to suprathermal\nrotation. This effect acts to reduce the alignment of small grains.\n  The observed variation of grain alignment with grain size would then result\nfrom a combination of the thermal flipping process -- which suppresses\nsuprathermal rotation of small grains -- and due to molecular hydrogen\nformation and starlight -- which drive large grains to suprathermal rotation\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 1999 01:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We generalize to the plane and to the hyperbolic plane a theorem\nconcerning the equidistribution of the zeros of psi(z) previously demonstrated\nfor a spherical phase space (SU(2) polynomials). For systems with time reversal\nsymmetry, the number of real roots is computed for the three geometries. In the\nsemiclassical regime, the local correlation functions are shown to be\nuniversal, independent of the system considered or the geometry of phase space.\nIn particular, the autocorrelation function of psi is given by a Gaussian\nfunction. The connections between this model and the Gaussian random function\nhypothesis as well as the random matrix theory are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 1999 17:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
