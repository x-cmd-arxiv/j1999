While high luminosity Z-sources are especially bright in the standard\nX-ray band (e.g. 2-10 keV), lower luminosity systems are dominating the flux\nabove 30 keV. The two hardest sources in the region, i.e. 1E1740.7-2942 and GRS\n1758-258 are thought to be black hole candidates (BHC) based on the similarity\nof spectral properties and short-term variability to that of dynamically proven\nBHCs. However, while most of the other galactic BHCs are known to be\ntransients, these two objects could be considered persistent though variable\nsources. The persistent behavior of these sources implies some constraints on\nthe parameters of the binary systems. Both sources were detected in the first\nGRANAT observation of the GC region. They are the only two persistent BHCs seen\nin the 35-75 keV SIGMA image after collecting several million seconds of\nexposure time over eight years, indicating that they are perhaps the only two\npersistent BHCs in the region.\n  Another peculiar object in the field is of course a putative supermassive\nblack hole (Sgr A*) at the dynamic center of our Galaxy. The present day's\nX-ray luminosity from Sgr A* is very small ($\\la 10^{36}$ erg/s). However an\nindication that Sgr A* might have been much brighter in the past was found\nwhile studying diffuse X-ray emission in the region. We speculate here on how\nfuture X-ray observatories may verify the hypothesis of the violent activity of\nSgr A* in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 1999 13:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Therefore, the coupling between the Grinfeld and the\nMullins-Sekerka instabilities becomes strong, as the critical wavelength of the\nformer instability gets reduced to a value close to that of the latter.\nAnalogously, in the case of eutectics, the characteristic length scale of the\nGrinfeld instability should be reduced to a size not extremely far from typical\nlamellar spacings. In a Jackson-Hunt like approach we average the undercooling,\nincluding the stress term, over a pair of lamellae. Following Jackson and Hunt,\nwe assume the selected wavelength to be determined by the minimum undercooling\ncriterion and compute its shift due to the external stress. we realize the\nshifting of the wavelength by the application of external stress. In addition,\nwe find that in general the volume fraction of the two solid phases is changed\nby uniaxial stress.

The original analysis by Unruh and Wald\nmade the approximation that the box was ``thin'', but they later generalized\ntheir analysis to thick boxes (in the context of a slightly different process).\nNevertheless, Bekenstein has argued that, for a certain class of thick boxes,\nthe buoyancy force of the ``thermal atmosphere'' of the black hole is\nnegligible, and that his previously postulated bound on $S/E$ is necessary for\nthe validity of the generalized second law. In arguing for these conclusions,\nBekenstein made some assumptions about the nature of unconstrained thermal\nmatter and the location of the ``floating point'' of the box. We show here that\nunder these assumptions, Bekenstein's bound on $S/E$ follows automatically from\nthe fact that $S$ is bounded by the entropy of unconstrained thermal matter.\nThus, a box of matter which violates Bekenstein's bound would violate the\nassumptions made in his analysis, rather than violate the generalized second\nlaw. Indeed, we prove here that no universal entropy bound need be hypothesized\nin order to ensure the validity of the generalized second law in this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 1999 21:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

The deviations from this gross scaling for p+A and\nS+Au reactions at 200AGeV are compared to model predictions and the\nimplications are discussed. Within this picture no universal scaling law for\nhigh pT particle production is obtained. In addition to the conceptual problems\nof such an incoherent model, it is shown that the implied kinematic relation\nbetween a possible pT-broadening and deceleration leads to contradictions. The\nscaling of pion production at intermediate pT with system size does not\nindicate a multiple scattering enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 1999 16:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Particular emphasis is on $^{12}$C, the ingredient of liquid\nscintillator, and on $^{16}$ the main component of the water \\v{C}erenkov\ndetectors. First, I show that the data on the exclusive process populating the\nground state of $^{12}$N are well reproduced by the theory. This is also the\ncase for the excitation of the continuum with low energy neutrinos from the\nmuon decay at rest and for the muon capture. However, for not yet understood\nreasons, the theory overestimates the cross section for higher energy neutrinos\nfrom the pion decay in flight, by up to 50%. I also show that the Continuum\nRandom Phase Approximation and the Relativistic Fermi Gas model give very\nsimilar full and differential cross sections for the neutrino energies of\nseveral hundred MeV, thus checking one method against the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 1999 18:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
