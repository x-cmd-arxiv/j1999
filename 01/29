Large clusters will distort the observed shapes of\nbackground galaxies through gravitational lensing allowing the measurement of\nthe cluster mass distributions. For most cases, the agreement between weak\nlensing and radial velocity mass measurements of clusters is reasonably good.\nThere is, however, one significant exception, the z=0.32 cluster MS1224.7+2007,\nwhich has a lensing mass substantially larger than the virial mass and also a\nvery high mass-to-light ratio. Since this controversial object might be an\nunusually dark mass a follow-up study is definitely warranted. In this paper we\nstudy the mass and light distributions of MS1224+2007 out to a projected radius\nof 800/h kpc by measuring the gravitationally-induced distortions of background\ngalaxies.

The resultant mass\nmap exhibits a peak centered on the dominant cluster galaxy and strong evidence\nfor substructure which is even more strongly seen in the galaxy distribution.\nAssuming all the detected shear is due to mass at z=0.32 we find cluster\nmass-to-light ratio of M/L_R = 640 +/- 150.

By fine tuning this parameter, it is shown that the\nmodel can work successfully for both boron and arsenic implants. We report that\nthe results of the dopant profile simulation for both species are in excellent\nagreement with the experimental profiles measured by secondary-ion mass\nspectrometry(SIMS) over a wide range of energies and with different incident\ndirections. We point out that the model has wide applicability, for it captures\nthe correct physics of electronic stopping in ion implantation. This model also\nprovides a good physically-based damping mechanism for molecular dynamics\nsimulations in the electronic stopping power regime, as evidenced by the\nstriking agreement of dopant profiles calculated in our molecular dynamics\nsimulations with the SIMS data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 1999 23:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The excitation of linear waves\nby one-dimensional bunch is considered on this background. It is shown that\nthere are three types of solutions of linear equations obtained for induced\nwaves corresponding to three ranges of parameter values of the pump wave, bunch\nand plasma. In the first range of parameter values the amplitude of transverse\ncomponents of induced waves is shown to grow as the bunch energy and after some\nvalue of the relativistic factor of the bunch to be almost independent of the\nenergy and increase proportional to the intensity and frequency of the pump\nwave. The dependence of longitudinal component of induced waves on the\nrelativistic factor of the bunch is weak. Its amplitude and wavelength grow as\nthe intensity of pump wave. The second range of parameters is a resonance one.\nThe amplitude of the wave excited by the bunch is a linear function of the\ndistance to the bunch. In the third range of parameter values the longitudinal\ncomponent of induced fields are localized near the bunch boundaries and are\nexponentially decreased with the increase in distance from these boundaries.\nThe amplitudes of transverse components of induced waves reach a constant value\nwith the distance from the bunch boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 1999 09:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
