Observed variations in GCS specific frequencies (S_N=N_gc/L_gal), both\nas a function of galactocentric radius in individual systems and globally\nbetween entire galaxies, are reviewed in this light. It is argued that trends\nin S_N do not reflect any real variation in the underlying efficiency of\ncluster formation; rather, they result from ignoring the hot gas in many large\nellipticals. This claim is checked and confirmed in each of M87, M49, and NGC\n1399, for which existing data are combined to show that the volume density\nprofile of globular clusters, rho_cl, is directly proportional to the sum of\n(rho_gas+rho_stars) at large radii.

Thermodynamic and structural properties are\ninvestigated and some predictions are made when the mixed solvent approaches\ncriticality. Both the single and the many chain problems are examined. When the\npure mixed solvent is near criticality, addition of a small amount of polymers\nshifts the criticality towards either enhanced compatibility or induced phase\nseparation depending upon the value of the parameter describing the interaction\nasymmetry of the solvents with respect to the polymer. The polymer-solvent\neffective interaction parameter increases strongly when the solvent mixture\napproaches criticality. Accordingly, the apparent excluded volume parameter\ndecreases and may vanish or even become negative. Consequently, the polymer\nundergoes a phase transition from a swollen state to an unperturbed state or\neven take a collapsed configuration. The effective potential acting on a test\nchain in strong solutions is calculated and the concept of Edwards screening\ndiscussed. Structural properties of ternary mixtures of polymers in mixed\nsolvents are investigated within the Edwards Hamiltonian model. It is shown\nthat the effective potential on a test chain in strong solutions could be\nwritten as an infinite series expansion of terms describing interactions via\none chain, two chains etc. This summation can be performed following a similar\nscheme as in the Ornstein-Zernike series expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 1999 12:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The KM ansatz\nconstitutes the minimal implementation of CP violation: without requiring\nunknown degrees of freedom it can reproduce the known CP phenomenology in a\nnontrivial way. (ii) The physics of beauty hadrons -- in particular their weak\ndecays -- opens a novel window onto fundamental dynamics: they usher in a new\nquark family (presumably the last one); they allow us to determine fundamental\nquantities of the Standard Model like the $b$ quark mass and the CKM parameters\n$V(cb)$, $V(ub)$, $V(ts)$ and $V(td)$; they exhibit speedy or even rapid $B^0 -\n\\bar B^0$J oscillations. (iii) Heavy Quark Expansions allow us to treat $B$\ndecays with an accuracy that would not have been thought possible a mere decade\nago. These three threads are joined together in the following manner: (a) Huge\nCP asymmetries are {\\em pre}dicted in $B$ decays, which represents a decisive\ntest of the KM paradigm for CP violation. (b) Some of these predictions are\nmade with high {\\em parametric} reliability, which (c) can be translated into\n{\\em numerical} precision through the judicious employment of novel theoretical\ntechnologies. (d) Beauty decays thus provide us with a rich and promising field\nto search for New Physics and even study some of its salient features. At the\nend of it there might quite possibly be a New Paradigm for High Energy Physics.\nThere will be some other threads woven into this tapistry: electric dipole\nmoments, and CP violation in other strange and in charm decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 1999 06:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 1999 03:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

It has a Lax pair that is gauge equivalent to the Lax pair of the matrix\nnon-linear Schrodinger equation (MNLS). We construct via gauge transformations\nan isomorphism from C(R,M) to the phase space of the MNLS equation so that the\nGNLS flow corresponds to the MNLS flow. The existence of global solutions to\nthe Cauchy problem for GNLS and the hierarchy of commuting flows follows from\nthe correspondence. Direct geometric constructions show the flows are given by\ngeometric partial differential equations, and the space of conservation laws\nhas a structure of a non-abelian Poisson group. We also construct a hierarchy\nof symplectic structures for GNLS. Under pullback, the known order k symplectic\nstructures correspond to the order (k-2) symplectic structures that we find.\nThe shift by two is a surprise, and is due to the fact that the group\nstructures depend on gauge choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 1999 15:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
