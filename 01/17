NICMOS coronagraph\nobservations at 1.1 and 1.6 microns reveal a ring-like symmetrical structure\npeaking in reflected intensity 1.05 arcsec +/- 0.02 arcsec (~ 70 AU) from the\ncentral A0V star. The ring geometry, with an inclination of 73.1 deg +/- 1.2\ndeg and a major axis PA of 26.8 deg +/- 0.6 deg, is in good agreement with\nrecent 12.5 and 20.8 micron observations of a truncated disk (Koerner, et al.\n1998). The ring is resolved with a characteristic width of less than 0.26\narcsec (17 AU) and appears abruptly truncated at both the inner and outer\nedges. The region of the disk-plane inward of ~60 AU appears to be relatively\nfree of scattering material. The integrated flux density of the part of the\ndisk that is visible (greater than 0.65 arcsec from the star) is found to be\n7.5 +/- 0.5 mJy and 7.4 +/- 1.2 mJy at 1.1 and 1.6 microns, respectively.\nCorrecting for the unseen area of the ring yields total flux densities of 12.8\n+/- 1.0 mJy and 12.5 +/- 2.0 mJy, respectively (Vega magnitudes = 12.92 /+-\n0.08 and 12.35 +/-0.18). The NIR luminosity ratio is evaluated from these\nresults and ground-based photometry of the star. At these wavelengths\nLdisk(lambda)/L*(lambda) = 1.4 +/- 0.2E-3 and 2.4 +/- 0.5E-3, giving reasonable\nagreement between the stellar flux scattered in the NIR and that which is\nabsorbed in the visible and re-radiated in the thermal infrared. The somewhat\nred reflectance of the disk at these wavelengths implies mean particle sizes in\nexcess of several microns, larger than typical interstellar grains. The\nconfinement of material to a relatively narrow annular zone implies dynamical\nconstraints on the disk particles by one or more as yet unseen bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 1999 20:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Particular emphasis is placed on the part played by\nthe running of the coupling. It is shown that the solution factorizes into a\npart describing the evolution in Q^2, and a constant part describing the input\ndistribution. The latter is infrared dominated, being described by a coupling\nwhich grows as x decreases, and thus being contaminated by infrared\nrenormalons. Hence, for this part we agree with previous assertions that\npredictive power breaks down for small enough x at any Q^2. However, the former\nis ultraviolet dominated, being described by a coupling which falls like\n1/(\\ln(Q^2/\\Lambda^2) + A(\\bar\\alpha_s(Q^2)\\ln(1/x))^1/2)with decreasing x, and\nthus is perturbatively calculable at all x. Therefore, although the BFKL\nequation is unable to predict the input for a structure function for small x,\nit is able to predict its evolution in Q^2, as we would expect from the\nfactorization theory. The evolution at small x has no true powerlike behaviour\ndue to the fall of the coupling, but does have significant differences from\nthat predicted from a standard NLO in alpha_s treatment.

This gate can be realized by classical estimation and subsequent\nre-preparation of complements of the estimated state. Its fidelity is therefore\nequal to the fidelity F= (N+1)/(N+2) of optimal estimation, and does not depend\non the required number of outputs. We also show that when some additional a\npriori information about the state of input qubit is available, than the\nfidelity of the quantum NOT gate can be much better than the fidelity of\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 1999 11:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
