The rise in $\\gamma = C/T$ between 7 K and\n330 mK and the absence of a large entropy liberated at $T^\\ast$ may be due to a\ncombination of Kondo screening effects and frustration that strongly modifies\nthe low T transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 1999 00:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
