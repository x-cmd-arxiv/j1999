The observations\nspanned 10 days, including 56% coverage for 7 d, and allowed us to find time\nsegments which clearly demonstrate continuous evolution along the horizontal,\nnormal, and flaring branches (HB/NB/FB) of a Z-source low-mass X-ray binary.\nThese results confirm and extend the behavior we inferred from earlier\nobservations. Here we study the continuous evolution of the Fourier power\nspectra and the energy spectra around the complete hardness-intensity track. A\nnarrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) peak, previously observed in the power\nspectra at 1.3-32 Hz, increases in frequency from 12 Hz to 25 Hz moving down a\nvertical extension of the HB in the hardness-intensity diagram. These\nhorizontal branch QPOs (HBOs) occur near 30 Hz and fade in strength on the\nhorizontal portion of the HB, while a broad peak in the power spectrum arises\nnear 4 Hz. This peak becomes much more prominent along the NB and remains near\n4 Hz (the normal branch QPOs, or NBOs). On the FB, neither QPO is present and\nthe power spectrum is dominated by very low frequency noise. We also found that\neach branch of the spectral track is associated with a specific type of\nevolution of the energy spectrum. We explored various models for the energy\nspectrum and parameterized the evolution of the spectrum in terms of a\ntwo-component model consisting of a multi-temperature \"disk blackbody\" and a\nhigher-temperature (~2 keV) blackbody. We also show that an unusual line- or\nedge-like feature occurs at ~10 keV in energy spectra from the FB and lower NB.\nThis unusual feature is very similar to one seen on the FB and lower NB of the\nZ source GX 5-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 1999 04:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
