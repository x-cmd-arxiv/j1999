For $\\bar{B}=0$, the governing parameter is $\\alpha=d/R_0$,\nwhere $d$ is the correlation length of disorder and $R_0$ is the Larmor radius\nin the field $B_0$. While for $\\alpha\\ll 1$ the Drude theory applies, at\n$\\alpha\\gg 1$ most particles drift adiabatically along closed contours and are\nlocalized in the adiabatic approximation. The conductivity is then determined\nby a special class of trajectories, the \"snake states\", which percolate by\nscattering at the saddle points of $B({\\bf r})$ where the adiabaticity of their\nmotion breaks down. The external field also suppresses the diffusion by\ncreating a percolation network of drifting cyclotron orbits.

The central paradigm is that space-time {\\it topology} is\nultimately responsible for the Heisenberg uncertaintly principle. It is found\nthat Plankian space-time exhibits a complicated, but also definite, multiply\nconnected character. In this framework, an analysis of the interactions in\nNature is presented.\n  I. The Universal ground state of the constructed theory derives from the\nproperties of the topological manifold $Q=2T^3\\oplus 3S^1\\times S^2$, which has\n23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\\times Z_3$ internal\ngroups, an SU(5) gauge group, and leads to a U(1) symmetry on a lattice. The\nstructure of $Q$ provides a unique equation motion for the mass-energy and\nparticle rest mass wave functions. In its excited state the Universe is\ncharacterized by a lattice of three-tori, $L(T^3)$. The topological\nidentifications present in this structure, a direct reflection of the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle, provide the boundary conditions for solutions\nto the equation of motion, and suggest an interpretation for the conceptually\ndifficult concept of quantum mechanical entanglement. II. In the second half of\nthe paper the (observable) properties of $Q$ and $L(T^3)$ are investigated.

This calculation is expected to be valid for energies below 100\nMeV. Pion-exchange, relativistic, and recoil corrections are also included. The\nlow-energy theorem for gauge invariance is shown to be satisfied. The relative\neffects of the different terms and their effects on the determinations of the\npolarizabilities are discussed at energies of 49, 69, and 95 MeV. The\ncross-section is dominated by the seagull, polarizability, and electromagnetic\nmultipole interactions. Relativistic and pion-exchange terms are also\nimportant, while recoil corrections and multipoles of $L$=2 and greater are\nnegligible. The calculation provides a reasonable description of the\nexperimental data points at 49 and 69 MeV. The polarizabilities are difficult\nto determine at these energies. A more accurate determination of the\npolarizabilities may be possible at 95 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 1999 19:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
