The\nemission line characteristics of these galaxies are complex, varying between\nSeyfert 2 and LINERs or between LINERs and starbursts. All of the galaxies show\ntraces of intermediate age stellar populations, supporting our previous result\nthat post-starburst galaxies are common in compact groups. The galaxies\nHCG16--4 and HCG16--5 show double nuclei and therefore could be two cases of\nrecent merger. Our observations support a scenario where HCG 16 was formed by\nthe successive merger of metal poor, low mass galaxies. The galaxies HCG16--1\nand HCG16--2, which are more evolved, form the old core of the group. Galaxies\nHCG16--4 and HCG16--5 are two more recent additions still in a merging phase.\nGalaxy HCG16--5 is a starburst galaxy which is just beginning to fall into the\ncore. If HCG 16 is representative of compact groups in their early stage, the\nwhole set of observations implies that the formation of compact groups is the\nresult of hierarchical galaxy formation. HCG 16 could be one example of this\nprocess operating in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 1999 16:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

By varying the angle between the axes of\ndeformation and the transverse direction of the pair momenta, the suppression\nof $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Psi'$ will oscillate in a characteristic way. Whereas the\naverage suppression is mostly sensitive to the early and high density stages of\nthe collision, the amplitude is more sensitive to the late stages. This effect\nprovides additional information on the $J/\\Psi$ suppression mechanisms such as\ndirect absorption on participating nucleons, comover absorption or formation of\na quark-gluon plasma. The behavior of the average $J/\\Psi$ suppression and its\namplitude with centrality of the collisions is discussed for SPS, RHIC and LHC\nenergies with and without a phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 1999 08:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 1999 13:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
