We examine these\nsimulations for morphological and dynamical differences, focusing on the\nvelocity field, the width of the cocoon, the age of the jets, and the internal\nstructure of the jet itself. The primary result of these comparisons is that\nthe velocity field of nonrelativistic jet simulations cannot be scaled up to\ngive the spatial distribution of Lorentz factors seen in relativistic\nsimulations. Since the local Lorentz factor plays a major role in determining\nthe total intensity for parsec scale extragalactic jets, this suggests that a\nnonrelativistic simulation cannot yield the proper intensity distribution for a\nrelativistic jet. Another general result is that each relativistic jet and its\nnonrelativistic equivalents have similar ages (in dynamical time units, =\nR/a_a, where R is the initial radius of a cylindrical jet and a_a is the sound\nspeed in the ambient medium). In addition to these comparisons, we have\ncompleted four new relativistic simulations to investigate the effect of\nvarying thermal pressure on relativistic jets.

All the observed bursts have a\nslow exponential rise, a sharp linear decay, and they can broadly be put in two\nclasses: irregular and quasi-regular bursts in one class, and regular bursts in\nanother class. The regular bursts are found to have two distinct time scales\nand they persist over extended durations. There is a strong correlation between\nthe preceding quiescent time and the burst duration for the quasi-regular and\nirregular bursts. No such correlation is found for the regular bursts. The\nratio of average flux during the burst time to the average flux during the\nquiescent phase is high and variable for the quasi- regular and irregular\nbursts while it is low and constant for the regular bursts. We suggest that the\npeculiar bursts that we have seen are charact- eristic of the change of state\nof the source. The source can switch back and forth between the low-hard state\nand the high-soft state near critical accretion rates in a very short time\nscale.

The two states retained per unit cell are the Wannier functions\nassociated with the valence and conduction bands. By a comparison of the\npredictions of this model to a four state model (which includes the non-bonding\nstates) and a full P-P-P model calculation on benzene and biphenyl, it is shown\nquantitatively how the 2-MO model fails to predict the correct excitation\nenergies.

This calculation is expected to be valid for energies\nbelow 100 MeV. Previous theoretical and experimental estimates for the\npolarizabilities are given. All diagrams are calculated by expanding the photon\nwavefunctions into partial waves and using realistic deuteron wavefunctions.\nThe Green's function for the intermediate state in the dispersive states is\ndetermined numerically. Pion-exchange, relativistic, and recoil corrections are\nalso included. The low-energy theorem is shown to be satisfied. The relative\neffects of the different terms as well as their effects on the determinations\nof the polarizabilities are discussed at energies of 49, 69, and 95 MeV. The\ncross-section is dominated by the seagull, polarizability, and electromagnetic\nmultipole interactions.

Also, since no\nground state seems to exist for matter, Dirac predicted that negative matter\nmust exist to keep all of matter from disappearing into negative energy states.\nAnd Einstein showed that all things are relative except the speed of light.\nTogether, these imply that 4 negative dimensions (Ds) are overlapped by the 4\npositive Ds; that positive and negative matters reside in these 2 separate sets\nof Ds; and that their separateness prevents their mutual annihilation. Light\nwould then exist as an oscillation of the interface between these 2 sets of Ds,\nwith the 2 relative matters varying equally on each side; thus allowing light\nto remain constant. And since 2 negatives make a positive, the 2 sets would\nmove as one, even though they are opposites. This means that the 2 sets always\nremain exactly overlapped; and so, the negative Ds remain disguised. Our\nuniverse therefore could be a dual universe. Also, 8+2 Ds makes a total of 10\nDs; 4x4=16 interactions, and 10+16 = 26. So our 4 D world could act as a 10/26\nD world; which matches the 2 sets within which string theory is self-\nconsistent.
