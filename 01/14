As a corollary to the inversion of the\ndensity in the Local Group rest frame we present an expression for estimating\nthe real space velocity dipole from redshift space, allowing one to estimate\nthe Local Group dipole without full reconstruction of the redshift survey. We\ntest these results on some simple models and find the reconstruction is very\naccurate. A new spherical harmonic representation of the redshift distortion\nand its inverse is developed, which simplifies the reconstruction and allows\nanalytic calculation of the properties of the reconstructed redshift survey.

Equivalently, these results may be phrased as general\nbounds on the Bogolubov coefficients, or statements about the transfer matrix.\nA similar analysis can be provided for the parametric change of frequency of a\nharmonic oscillator. A number of specific examples are discussed---in\nparticular I provide a general proof that sharp step function potentials always\nscatter more effectively than the corresponding smoothed potentials. The\nanalysis also serves to collect together and unify what would otherwise appear\nto be quite unrelated results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 1999 05:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the\npresent article, however, we introduce a new quantization rule by which these\nquantities are regarded as operators in addition to the position and the\nmomentum. Applying this new rule to a scalar particle and to a particle with\nspin $ 1/2 $, we analyze the time evolution of the operator $\\tau $. In the\nformer case, the evolution of the proper time perfectly matches several\nwell-established classical formulae. In the case of the particle with spin 1/2,\nour new rule implies that an oscillation appears in the time evolution of the\noperator $\\tau $. This oscillation is similar to Zitterbewegung which is\nwell-known in the ordinary Dirac theory. We formulate one physical effect of\nthis oscillation by considering the interaction with a gravitational field, and\nestimate how small it is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 1999 09:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 1999 09:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
