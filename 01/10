Because of the excellent HRI\npositions, 83 X-ray sources with fluxes (0.5-2 keV) above 1.2E-15 erg/cm2/s\ncould be optically identified so far utilizing deep optical CCD images, NIR\nphotometry and Keck spectroscopy. Only 11 sources above this flux limit remain\nunidentified.

It is found that multiple-streaming can be\nsignificant in redshift-space but negligible in real-space, even at moderate\nvalues of the linear fluctuation amplitude ($\\sigma < 1$). Moreover, unlike\ntheir real-space counter-parts, redshift-space multiple-streams can flow past\neach other with minimal interactions. Such nonlinear redshift-space effects,\nwhich operate even when the real-space density field is quite linear, could\nsuppress the classic compression of redshift-structures predicted by linear\ntheory (Kaiser 1987).
