Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin\nfor the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space\ndistribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be\nquantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10 Gyr few obvious\nasymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space,\nstrong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple\nanalytic description of these effects, based on a linearised treatment in\naction-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of\nthe debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that\na single satellite of current luminosity $10^8 L_\\sun$ disrupted 10 Gyr ago\nfrom an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre $\\sim 12$ kpc)\nwould contribute about $\\sim 30$ kinematically cold streams with internal\nvelocity dispersions below 5 km/s to the local stellar halo. If the whole\nstellar halo were built by disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of\n300 - 500 such streams.

When the applied electric field is parallel to the quantum well plane,\nwe demonstrate that, for in-plane magnetic field orientation, the discrete\nconfined exciton peak undergoes a transition into a continuum resonance. In\ncontrast, for perpendicular magnetic fields, the exciton peak exhibits the\nusual Stark red-shift. We show that such a dramatic dependence on the magnetic\nfield orientation originates from a resonant coupling between the confined and\nthe bulk-like excitons. Such coupling is caused by the interplay between the\nquantum-well potential and a velocity-dependent two-body interaction between\nthe exciton center-of-mass and relative motion degrees of freedom induced by\nthe in-plane magnetic field. As a result, the exciton tunnels out of the\nquantum well as a whole without being ionized.

These effects may arise through\nspontaneous symmetry breaking in a more complete Lorentz covariant theory\nunderlying the standard model. In this work the issue of parameterizing such\nviolations in a consistent and complete manner is addressed. The approach is to\nuse the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking to generate all possible\nterms consistent with gauge invariance and power-counting renormalizability to\nconstruct an extension of the standard model that includes Lorentz- and\nCPT-breaking terms. A consistent quantization of the theory is developed,\nconventional quantum field theoretic techniques are shown to apply, and some\nramifications for quantum electrodynamics are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 1999 20:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
