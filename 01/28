A cooperative model is presented, in which coupling between\nneighbouring receptor dimers enhances the sensitivity with which stimuli can be\ndetected, without diminishing the range of chemoeffector concentration over\nwhich chemotaxis can operate. Individual receptor dimers have two stable\nconformational states: one active, one inactive. Noise gives rise to a\ndistribution between these states, with the probability influenced by ligand\nbinding, and also by the conformational states of adjacent receptor dimers. The\ntwo-state model is solved, based on an equivalence with the Ising model in a\nrandomly distributed magnetic field. The model has only two effective\nparameters, and unifies a number of experimental findings. According to the\nvalue of the parameter comparing coupling and noise, the signal can be\narbitrarily sensitive to changes in the fraction of receptor dimers to which\nligand is bound. The counteracting effect of a change of methylation level is\nmapped to an induced field in the Ising model.
