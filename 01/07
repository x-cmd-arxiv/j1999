The\nforest method determines these weights based on the load balancing among\nprocessors by means of the over-load diffusion (OLD).

A new treatment of the classical\nKustaanheimo-Stiefel two-body regularization has proved to be more accurate for\nstudying binaries than previous algorithms based on divided differences or\nHermite integration. This formulation employs a Taylor series expansion\ncombined with the Stumpff functions, still with one force evaluation per step,\nwhich gives exact solutions for unperturbed motion and is at least comparable\nto the polynomial methods for large perturbations.

At lower\ntemperatures, the spectrum shifts and broadens. Both the shift and broadening\nexhibit Curie-Weiss behavior, indicating that the shift measures the\npolarization of the electron spin system, and the broadening reflects a\ndistribution of magnetic susceptibilities. This distribution may result from\nvariations of local susceptibility in the bulk of the sample or from\ndifferences in demagnetizing factors among powder grains.

Variation of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation across the spectrum\nindicate that magnetic fluctuations, not lattice vibrations, dominate nuclear\nrelaxation. Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation therefore measures electron spin\ndynamics in this system. The magnetic field dependence of the spin-lattice\nrelaxation indicates that the electron spin-spin correlation function adopts\nsimple single exponential behavior with a slow field-independent correlation\ntime of 10^{-8} seconds near Tc.
