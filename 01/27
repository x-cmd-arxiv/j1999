For the actual dynamics, an NJL-type realization of DBchiS is\nachieved via the interplay of Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) and Schwinger-Dyson (SDE)\nequations, which are simultaneously derivable from a chiral Lagrangian with a\ngluonic (Vector-exchange) 4-fermion interaction of `current' uds quarks,\nspecifically addressing the non-perturbative regime. A prior critique of the\nliterature on various aspects of the non-perturbative QCD problem, on the basis\nof some standard criteria, helps converge on a BSE-SDE framework with a 3D-4D\ninterconnection based on MYTP. This framework is then employed for a systematic\nself-contained presentation of 2- and 3-quark dynamics on the lines of\nMYTP-governed DBchiS, with enough calculational details illustrating the\ntechniques involved.
