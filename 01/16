For the ten SNe included in\nthis study, five strongly suggest $^{56}$Co positron escape as would be\npermitted by a weak or radially-combed magnetic field. Of the remaining five\nSNe, none clearly show the upturned light curve expected for positron trapping\nin a strong, tangled magnetic field. Chandrasekhar mass models can explain\nnormally, sub-, and super- luminous supernova light curves; sub-Chandrasekhar\nmass models have difficulties with sub- (and potentially normally) luminous\nSNe.

There is some observational motivation to at least consider\nthe role that an effectively concave disc surface might play: (1) a reprocessed\nfraction $\\gsim 1/2$ in some Seyferts and possibly in the X-ray background, and\n(2) the commonality of a sharp iron line peak for Seyferts at 6.4KeV despite a\ndependence of peak location on inclination angle for flat disc models.

This reduces the sensitivity\nof the 6.4KeV peak location to the inner disc inclination angle because the\nouter regions are less affected by Doppler and gravitational effects.

Applying the standard reconstruction\nalgorithms to each bandwidth-limited quantum trajectory, a \"spectrum\" of\ndensity matrices and Wigner functions is obtained. The recorded states show a\nsmooth transition from the squeezed vacuum to a vacuum state. In the time\ndomain we evaluated the first order correlation function of the squeezed output\nfield, showing good agreement with the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 1999 17:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
