In particular, two rare\nkaon decays are analyzed: The first decay, K_L -> pi0 e+e-, is being searched\nfor as a signal of direct Delta S = 1 CP violation.

This may potentially\nbe useful in determining whether direct CP violation is present. The second\ndecay, K_L -> pi0 gamma e+e-, which occurs at a higher rate than the\nnonradiative process K_L -> pi0 e+e-, can be a background to CP violation\nstudies using the latter reaction.
