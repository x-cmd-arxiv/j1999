Tested physical features include: packing or steric effects, the role of\nattractive forces that lower the solvent pressure, and the roughly tetrahedral\ncoordination of water molecules in liquid water. Packing effects (hard sphere\ndefault model) and packing effects plus attractive forces (Lennard-Jones\ndefault model) are ineffective in improving the prediction of hydrophobic\nhydration free energies of inert gases over the previously used Gibbs and flat\ndefault models. However, a conceptually simple cluster Poisson model that\nincorporates tetrahedral coordination structure in the default model is one of\nthe better performers for these predictions. These results provide a partial\nrationalization of the remarkable performance of the flat default model with\ntwo moments in previous applications. The cluster Poisson default model thus\nwill be the subject of further refinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 1999 18:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
