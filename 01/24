While rare and difficult\nto detect, DEBs provide us with the potential to determine these distances with\nan accuracy better than 5%. The extensive photometry obtained in order to\ndetect DEBs provides us with good light curves for the Cepheid variables. These\nare essential to the parallel project to derive direct Baade-Wesselink\ndistances to Cepheids in M31 and M33. For both Cepheids and eclipsing binaries,\nthe distance estimates will be free of any intermediate steps.\n  As a first step in the DIRECT project, between September 1996 and October\n1997 we obtained 95 full/partial nights on the F. L. Whipple Observatory 1.2 m\ntelescope and 36 full nights on the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT 1.3 m telescope to\nsearch for DEBs and new Cepheids in the M31 and M33 galaxies.

Magic-number total angular\nmomenta that minimize the total energy are found to reflect a crossover between\nelectron configurations dominated by intra-layer correlation and ones dominated\nby inter-layer correlation. The position of the crossover is governed by the\nstrength of the inter-layer electron tunneling and magnetic field. The magic\nnumbers should have an observable effect on the far infra-red optical\nabsorption spectrum, since Kohn's theorem does not hold when the confinement\npotential is different for two dots. This is indeed confirmed here from a\nnumerical calculation that includes Landau level mixing. Our results take full\naccount of the effect of spin degrees of freedom. A key feature is that the\ntotal spin, $S$, of the system and the magic-number angular momentum are\nintimately linked because of strong electron correlation. Thus $S$ jumps hand\nin hand with the total angular momentum as the magnetic field is varied. One\nimportant consequence of this is that the spin blockade (an inhibition of\nsingle-electron tunneling) should occur in some magnetic field regions because\nof a spin selection rule. Owing to the flexibility arising from the presence of\nboth intra-layer and inter-layer correlations, the spin blockade is easier to\nrealize in double dots than in single dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 1999 06:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
