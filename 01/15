The fact that the long-range\nCoulomb interaction has no intrinsic length scale suggests that freezing in\nrandom polyampholyte globules might take place at all length scales,\ncorresponding to an overlap parameter q(x) that increases continuously from\nzero to its maximum value. Study of the polyampholyte globule within the\nindependent interaction approximation seems to confirm this scenario.

Using the more realistic\nsequence model we prove that in the general case of a random heteropolymer\nglobule containing two types of monomers such that unlike monomers attract each\nother, freezing at arbitrarily large length scales is not possible.

The initial photon dissociates into a $q\\bar{q}$-dipole and\ntransforms into a vector meson by scattering off the nucleon which, for\nsimplicity, is represented as quark-diquark. The relevant dipole-dipole\nscattering amplitude is provided by the non-perturbative model of the\nstochastic QCD vacuum. The wave functions result from considerations in the\nframe of light-front dynamics; the physical $\\rh'$- and $\\rh''$-mesons are\nassumed to be mixed states of an active 2S-excitation and some residual rest\n(2D- and/or hybrid state).
