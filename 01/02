Introducing the so-called primed\ninertial coordinate system, in addition to the usual inertial coordinate\nsystem, for each inertial frame of reference, we assume the flat structures of\ngravity-free space and time in the primed inertial coordinate system and,\nhence, their generalized Finslerian structures in the usual inertial coordinate\nsystem. We further modify the special theory of relativity by combining the\nalternative assumption with the two postulates (i) and (ii). The modified\nspecial relativity theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite\nspeed c-prime in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c in\nthe usual inertial coordinate system. It involves the c-prime-type Galilean\ntransformation between any two primed inertial coordinate systems and the\nlocalized Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate\nsystems. The physical principle in the modified special relativity theory is:\nthe c-prime-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system\nplus the transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate\nsystems. It combines with the quantum mechanics theory to found a convergent\nand invariant quantum field theory. We produce corrections to the Maxwellian\nvelocity and velocity rate distributions for free particles. The detection of\nvelocity and velocity rate distributions for free particles can serve as the\ntests to investigate the local structures of gravity-free space and time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 1999 21:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
