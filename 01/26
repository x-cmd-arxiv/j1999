There is a clear\nsignature of the choice of the microfield distribution in the adiabatic index\ngamma_1, which makes it accessible to present-day helioseismological analysis.\nBut since these thermodynamic effects of the microfield distribution are quite\nsmall, it also follows that the approximations chosen in the original MHD\nequation of state were reasonable.

These models are\nobtained through freely acting orbifold compactifications from the heterotic,\nthe symmetric and the asymmetric type II strings. The heterotic scalar\nmanifolds are (SU(1,1) / U(1))^3 for the S,T,U moduli sitting in the vector\nmultiplets and SO(4,4)/ (SO(4) X SO(4)) for those in the hypermultiplets. The\ntype II symmetric duals correspond to a self-mirror Calabi-Yau threefold\ncompactification with Hodge numbers h(1,1)=h(2,1)=3, while the type II\nasymmetric construction corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the N=(4,4)\nsupersymmetry to N=(2,0). Both have already been considered in the literature.\nThe heterotic construction instead is new and we show that there is a\nweak/strong coupling S-duality relation between the heterotic and the\nasymmetric type IIA ground state with S(Het)=-1/S(As); we also show that there\nis a partial restoration of N=8 supersymmetry in the heterotic strong-coupling\nregime. We compute the full (non-)perturbative R2 and F2 corrections and\ndetermine the prepotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 1999 19:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Dependence of oscillations frequency on beam\nscattering is determined by several factors, including changes of wire tension\ncaused by transverse force of the beam, influence of beam self field.\nPreliminary calculations show that influence caused by wire heating will\ndominate.
