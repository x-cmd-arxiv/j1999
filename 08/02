Gravitational lensing by a\nforeground cluster boosts the flux from cB58 by a factor of about 30 and\nprovides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physical\nproperties of star forming galaxies at high redshift. Our main results are as\nfollows. The ultraviolet spectral properties of cB58 are remarkably similar to\nthose of nearby star forming galaxies. The P-Cygni profiles of CIV and NV are\nbest matched by continuous star formation with a Salpeter IMF extending beyond\n50 solar masses---we find no evidence for either a flatter IMF (at the high\nmass end), or an IMF deficient in the most massive stars. There are clues in\nour data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few times\nbelow solar. Our best estimate, approximately equal to 1/4 solar, is 3 times\nhigher than the typical metallicity of damped Lyman alpha systems at the same\nredshift, consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the H I\nabsorption cross-section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than L*\nLyman break galaxies like cB58. The relative velocities of the stellar lines,\ninterstellar absorption, and H II emission indicate the existence of\nlarge-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of cB58, with a bulk outward\nmotion of 200 km/s and a mass loss rate of approximately 60 solar masses per\nyear, roughly comparable to the star formation rate. Such galactic winds may\nwell be the mechanism which self-regulates star formation, distributes metals\nover large volumes and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 1999 08:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

There are two main results of this work. First, the light curve\nof KPD 0422+5421 contains two distinct periodic signals, the 2.16 hour\nellipsoidal modulation discovered by Koen, Orosz, & Wade (1998) and an\nadditional modulation at 7.8 hours. This 7.8 hour modulation is clearly not\nsinusoidal: the rise time is about 0.25 in phase, whereas the decay time is\n0.75 in phase. Its amplitude is roughly half of the amplitude of the\nellipsoidal modulation. Second, after the 7.8 hour modulation is removed, the\nlight curve folded on the orbital period clearly shows the signature of the\ntransit of the white dwarf across the face of the sdB star and the signature of\nthe occultation of the white dwarf by the sdB star. We used the Wilson-Devinney\ncode to model the light curve to obtain the inclination, the mass ratio, and\nthe Omega potentials, and a Monte Carlo code to compute confidence limits on\ninteresting system parameters. We find component masses of M_sdB = 0.36 +/-\n0.16 solar masses and M_WD = 0.47 +/- 0.16 solar masses (M_total = 0.86 +/-\n0.35 solar masses, 68 per cent confidence limits).

In this case the total mass of the system is less than\n1.4 solar masses at the 99.99 per cent confidence level.

We give a survey on cyclotomic\nHecke algebras. These algebras have been studied by Dipper, James, Malle,\nMathas and the author. In lecture one, we start with definitions. We then go on\nto Specht module theory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras constructed by Dipper,\nJames and Mathas. In lecture two, we explain Ginzburg and Lusztig's theory on\naffine Hecke algebras and its application to cyclotomic Hecke algebras due to\nthe author. As Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of Hecke algebras describe decomposition\nnumbers of quantum algebras at roots of unity, canonical bases of quantum\naffine algebras on integrable modules describe decomposition numbers of\ncyclotomic Hecke algebras at roots of unity. In particular, it turns out that\ncrystal structure in the sense of Kashiwara exists behind the representation\ntheory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras. This was first observed by Lascoux,\nLeclerc and Thibon. Its interpretation in terms of socle series was proposed by\nRouquier. It is further developed in Vazirani's thesis. The special case of\nHecke algebras of type A is extensively studied, and its relation to Lusztig\nconjecture is now very clear. We explain Varagnolo and Vasserot's work and\nseveral algorithms proposed so far. Its application to the decomposition\nnumbers of finite general linear groups due to Dipper and James is also\nexplained. The parametrization of simple modules of cyclotomic Hecke algebras\nover arbitrary fields in terms of crystal graphs of quantum affine algebras is\ngiven by Mathas and the author.
