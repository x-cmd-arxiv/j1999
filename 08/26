In standard hierarchical collapse models, objects about the\nsize of normal galaxies and larger form a dense hot atmosphere when they\ncollapse. We show that if such an atmosphere forms a nearly \"maximal\" cooling\nflow, then a central black hole can accrete at close to its Eddington limit.\nThis leads to exponential growth of a seed black hole, resulting in a quasar in\nsome cases. In this model, the first quasars form soon after the first\ncollapses to produce hot gas. The hot gas is depleted as time progresses,\nmostly by cooling, so that the accretion rate eventually falls below the\nthreshold for advection-dominated accretion, at which stage radiative\nefficiency plummets and any quasar turns off. A simple implementation of this\nmodel, incorporated into a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation,\nover-produces quasars when compared with observed luminosity functions, but is\nconsistent with models of the X-ray Background which indicate that most\naccretion is obscured. It produces few quasars at high redshift due to the lack\nof time needed to grow massive black holes. Quasar fuelling by hot gas provides\na minimum level, sufficient to power most quasars at redshifts between one and\ntwo, to which other sources of fuel can be added. The results are sensitive to\nfeedback effects, such as might be due to radio jets and other outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 1999 18:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in cold\ndark matter dominated cosmological models. In models with a hotter\nintergalactic medium (IGM), the increased temperature enhances the pressure\ngradients between low and high density regions and this changes the spatial\ndistribution and the velocity field of the gas. Combined with more thermal\nbroadening, this leads to significantly wider absorption features in hotter\nmodels. Cosmological models with little small scale power also have broader\nabsorption features, because fluctuations on the scale of the Jeans length are\nstill in the linear regime . Consequently, both the amplitude of dark matter\nfluctuations on small scales and thermal smoothing affect the flux decrement\ndistribution in a similar way. However, the b-parameter distribution of Voigt\nprofile fits, obtained by deblending the absorption features into a sum of\nthermally broadened lines, is largely independent of the amount of small scale\npower, but does depend strongly on the IGM temperature. The same is true for\nthe two-point function of the flux and for the flux power spectrum on small\nscales. These three flux statistics are thus sensitive probes of the\ntemperature of the IGM.

In a recent paper we have shown that the SP\ndimerization attains long-range order only for x < x_c = 0.022(0.001). Here we\nreport that the SP transition is reentrant in the vicinity of the critical\nconcentration x_c. This is manifested by broadening of the SP dimerization\nsuperlattice peaks below the reentrance temperature, T_r, which may mean either\nthe complete loss of the long-range SP order or the development of a\nshort-range ordered component within the long-range ordered SP state. Marked\nhysteresis and very large relaxation times are found in the samples with Mg\nconcentrations in the vicinity of x_c. The reentrant transition is likely\nrelated to the competing Neel transition which occurs at a temperature similar\nto T_r. We argue that impurity-induced competing interchain interactions play\nan essential role in these phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 1999 02:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The upheaval is known to have occurred shortly after a\nvolcanic eruption, and companion work proposes that this eruption was colossal.\nHere, we suggest how the eruption acted as a trigger for the upheaval: by\nforcing changes in ocean circulation; although the initial (atmospheric)\nforcing lasted only a few years, the ocean required three centuries to regain\nequilibrium. The suggested triggering mechanism is supported by\npalaeoceanographic, palaeoecological, and archaeo-historical data and by\nrelated experiments with a (coupled general-circulation) climate model. We\nargue that the changes in ocean circulation forced changes in sea-surface\ntemperatures that led to a weakening of the south-west North African monsoon.\nThe upheaval has been proposed to have also encompassed south-western Asia. We\nargue that it encompassed most of the Northern Hemisphere: we present a variety\nof palaeoecological and palaeoceanographic evidence and describe the principal\nunderlying climatology. In some areas the upheaval was the most severe since\nthe ice ages. The full scope of the upheaval has previously been missed in part\nbecause radiocarbon dates from some areas are centuries too early:\npalaeoclimatic events in different areas thus appeared asynchronous. (The\nerroneous radiocarbon dates also misled searches seeking ice-core and tree-ring\nevidence of the eruption.)
