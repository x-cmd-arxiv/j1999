From an\nanalysis of CIV absorption in the 55 BG92 QSOs with available CIV data, we find\na remarkably strong correlation between alpha_ox and the CIV absorption\nequivalent width. This correlation suggests that absorption is the primary\ncause of soft X-ray weakness in QSOs, and it reveals a continuum of absorption\nproperties connecting unabsorbed QSOs, X-ray warm absorber QSOs, SXW QSOs and\nBAL QSOs. From a practical point of view, our correlation demonstrates that\nselection by soft X-ray weakness is an effective (>=80% successful) and\nobservationally inexpensive way to find low-redshift QSOs with strong and\ninteresting ultraviolet absorption. We have also identified several notable\ndifferences between the optical emission-line properties of SXW QSOs and those\nof the other BG92 QSOs.

The model space is extended from the valence space $(p^{-2})$ to the\nvalence space plus all 2$\\hbar \\omega$ excitations. The question is addressed\nas to what features of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction in the medium\nare required to obtain the vanishing $GT$ strength in this extended space. It\nturns out that a combination of a realistic strength of the tensor force\ncombined with a spin-orbit interaction which is enhanced as compared to the\nfree interaction yields a vanishing $GT$ strength. Such an interaction can be\nderived from a microscopic meson exchange potential if the enhancement of the\nsmall component of the Dirac spinors for the nucleons is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 1999 14:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
