The radio galaxy 53W002 was previously found to be\npart of a rich grouping at z=2.39, including 5 confirmed, compact, star-forming\nobjects. This is now shown to be part of a larger structure traced by bright\nAGN, all contained within a projected span of 6.8 arcmin (3.2 Mpc). Of the 14\ncandidate emitters, six have been spectroscopically confirmed as active nuclei\nin the range z=2.390 +/- 0.008. Various statistical tests give a significance\nof 95-99% for the reality of this structure on the sky. This grouping is more\nextended than a relaxed King model, at the 90% confidence level. Either this\nconfiguration has yet to decouple fully from the Hubble expansion, or it\nconsists of subgroups which will themselves form a more compact, relaxed\nstructure. The redshift range for measured members is comparable to the Hubble\nflow across the structure, which may imply that the structure is seen near\nturnaround.\n  We surveyed two additional fields at z=2.4, and three contiguous fields at\nz=2.6. Only a single candidate at z=2.4 was found, with six at z=2.6.\nComparison with the WFPC2 surveys suggests that the field-to-field contrast is\nlarger for brighter objects. From this survey alone, groupings such as the\n53W002 \"cluster\" must have an area covering fraction <0.04 in this redshift\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 1999 13:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Due to a special choice\nfor the lattice, this model has a strong-coupling limit where the\nsuperconductivity can be described by a bosonic theory, similar to the strongly\ncoupled negative U Hubbard model. This limit is analyzed in the present paper.\nA rich mean-field phase diagram is found and the leading quantum corrections to\nthe mean-field results are calculated.

The\natoms bend around three curves, each with a 15-cm radius of curvature, while\ntraveling along a 10-cm-long track. A maximum flux of 2*10^6 atoms/sec is\nachieved with a current density of 3*10^4 A/cm^2 in the\n100x100-micrometer-cross-section wires. The kinetic energy of the guided atoms\nin one transverse dimension is measured to be 42 microKelvin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 1999 22:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The analysis of the literature shows\nthere are the unresolved up to now significant contradictions between the\ntheory and the Schwarz experiments. To resolve these contradictions, the\ninterpretation of the Schwarz-Hora effect is considered, which is a development\nof the idea formulated by Schwarz and Hora. It is supposed that the interaction\nof electrons with the laser field inside a thin dielectric film is accompanied\nnot only by the processes of absorption and stimulated emission of photons but\nalso by formation of some metastable electron states in which the captured\nphotons can be transferred with a following emission at the target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 1999 12:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
