The\nFeynman integrals of this model can be decomposed in terms of an algebra of\nelementary vertex integrals whose structure we investigate. We derive a large\nclass of relations between multiple zeta values, of arbitrary lengths and\nweights, using only a certain set of graphical manipulations on Feynman\ndiagrams. Further uses and possible generalizations of the model are pointed\nout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 1999 22:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 1999 09:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2002 21:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

For the measured missing\nmomenta range from 10 to 165 MeV/c, no strength is observed for missing\nenergies higher than 20 MeV. Distorted momentum distributions were extracted\nfor the two-body breakup and the continuum. The longitudinal and transverse\nbehavior was studied by measuring the cross section for three photon\npolarizations. The longitudinal and transverse nature of the cross sections is\nwell described by a currently accepted and widely used prescription of the\noff-shell electron-nucleon cross-section.

The\nenergetics of the membrane, as a two-dimensional (2D) meso-scale continuum\nsheet, is described by the Canham-Helfrich Hamiltonian, with the membrane\nheight function treated as a stochastic process. The diffusion parameter of\nthis process acts as the link coupling the membrane shape fluctuations to the\nkinematics of the inclusions. The latter is described via Ito stochastic\ndifferential equation. In addition to stochastic forces, the inclusions also\nexperience membrane-induced deterministic forces.
