Solutions are given for the single scattering\nwith an electron beam and with a population of electrons isotropically\ndistributed, under the assumption that the energy distribution of the\nrelativistic particles follows a simple power law as it is the case in many\nastrophysical applications. Both the Thomson approximation and the\nKlein-Nishina regime are considered for the scattering of an unpolarized photon\nbeam. The equations are obtained without the ultra-relativistic approximation\nand are compared with the ultra-relativistic solutions given in the literature.\nThe main characteristics of the power distribution and spectra of the scattered\nradiation are discussed for relevant examples. In the Thomson case for an\nisotropic electron population simple formulae holding down to\nmildly-relativistic energies are given. As an application the formulae of the\nanisotropic inverse Compton scattering are used to predict the properties of\nthe X and $\\gamma$-ray spectra from the radio lobes of strong FR II radio\ngalaxies due to the interaction of the relativistic electrons with the incoming\nphotons from the nucleus. The dependence of the emitted power on the\nrelativistic electron energy distribution and on its evolution with time is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 1999 16:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Later the second author\nof the present paper generalized this result to the case of dynamical\nr-matrices, and showed that they correspond to generalized Belavin-Drinfeld\ntriples. The dynamical r-matrix corresponding a triple is given by a certain\nexplicit formula, which works for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In\nspecial cases, this formula gives the Felder and the Belavin r-matrix.\n  In 1994, Felder associated with every dynamical r-matrix a system of\ndifferential equations called the KZB equations. In the case of the Felder and\nBelavin r-matrix, solutions of these equations are known to have a\nrepresentation theoretical presentation, as conformal blocks (i.e. traces of\nproducts of intertwining operators between representations of Lie algebras).\n  In this paper, we propose such a presentation for ANY dynamical r-matrix\ngiven by the second author's formula.
