These\npermutations greatly reduce the number of two-locus models in the analysis of\ncomplex diseases.

Whenever possible, these non-redundant two-locus models\nare classified by their property. Besides the familiar features of\nmultiplicative models (logical AND), heterogeneity models (logical OR), and\nthreshold models, new classifications are added or expanded: modifying-effect\nmodels, logical XOR models, interference and negative interference models\n(neither dominant nor recessive), conditionally dominant/recessive models,\nmissing lethal genotype models, and highly symmetric models. The following\naspects of two-locus models are studied: the marginal penetrance tables at both\nloci, the expected joint identity-by-descent probabilities, and the correlation\nbetween marginal identity-by-descent probabilities at the two loci. These\nstudies are useful for linkage analyses using single-locus models while the\nunderlying disease model is two-locus, and for correlation analyses using the\nlinkage signals at different locations obtained by a single-locus model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 1999 21:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-09"}

A simple model is proposed here\nfor the formation of galaxy bulges and central black holes in which young\nspheroidal galaxies have a significant distributed component of cold dusty\nclouds which accounts for the absorption. The central accreting black hole is\nassumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the\nsurrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington\nlimit for the black hole. The wind however exerts the most force on the gas\nand, as earlier suggested by Silk & Rees, when the black hole reaches a\ncritical mass, it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so\nterminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy. In the present model this\npoint occurs when the Thomson depth in the surrounding gas has dropped to about\nunity and results in the mass of the black hole being proportional to the mass\nof the spheroid, with the normalization agreeing with that found for local\ngalaxies by Magorrian et al. for reasonable wind parameters. The model predicts\na new population of hard X-ray and sub-mm sources at redshifts above one which\nare powered by black holes in their main growth phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 1999 12:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The 5-195\nmicron SWS and LWS spectra are dominated by strong emission from circumstellar\ndust. We find that the dust consists of amorphous silicates, with a minor but\nsignificant contribution from crystalline silicates. The amorphous silicates\nconsist of Fe-rich olivines. The presence of amorphous pyroxenes cannot be\nexcluded but if present they contain much less Fe than the amorphous olivines.\nComparison with laboratory data shows that the pure Mg-end members of the\ncrystalline olivine and pyroxene solid solution series are present. In\naddition, we find strong evidence for simple oxides (FeO and Al2O3) as well as\ncrystalline H2O ice. Several narrow emission features remain unidentified.\nModelling of the dust emission using a dust radiation transfer code shows that\nlarge grains (~1 micron) must be present and that the abundance of the\ncrystalline silicates is between 7 and 15% of the total dust mass, depending on\nthe assumed enstatite to forsterite ratio, which is estimated to be between 1\nand 3.

Smash products of an\nalgebra times a Hopf algebra H are particular instances of these extensions,\nand in these cases we are able to define a differential calculus over their\nassociated vector bundles without requiring the use of a (bicovariant)\ndifferential structure over H. Moreover, if H is coquasitriangular, it coacts\nnaturally on the associated bundle, and the differential structure is\ncovariant.\n  We apply this construction to the case of the finite quotient of the SL_q(2)\nfunction Hopf algebra at a root of unity (q^3=1) as the structure group, and a\nreduced 2-dimensional quantum plane as both the \"base manifold\" and fibre,\ngetting an algebra which generalizes the notion of classical phase space for\nthis quantum space. We also build explicitly a differential complex for this\nphase space algebra, and find that levels 0 and 2 support a (co)representation\nof the quantum symplectic group. On this phase space we define vector fields,\nand with the help of the Sp_q structure we introduce a symplectic form relating\n1-forms to vector fields. This leads naturally to the introduction of Poisson\nbrackets, a necessary step to do \"classical\" mechanics on a quantum space, the\nquantum plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 1999 11:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 1999 13:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
