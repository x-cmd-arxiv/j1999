Our analysis uses stratified line-blanketed non-LTE model atmosphere\ncalculations to determine the shape of the intrinsic WD Lyman-alpha profile and\nestimate the WD photospheric contamination of the interstellar lines. Although\nthree velocity components were reported previously towards G191-B2B, we detect\nonly two velocity components. The first component is at V(hel) ~ 8.6 km/s and\nthe second at V(hel) ~ 19.3 km/s, which we identify with the Local Interstellar\nCloud (LIC). From the STIS data we derive D/H = 1.60(+0.39,-0.27)X10^-5 for the\nLIC component, and D/H > 1.26X10^-5 for the 8.6 km/s component (uncertainties\ndenote 2-sigma or 95% confidence limits). The STIS data provide no evidence for\nlocal or component-to-component variation in the D/H ratio. Despite using two\nvelocity components for the profile fitting and using a more physically\nrealistic WD Lyman-alpha profile for G191-B2B, our re-analysis of the GHRS data\nindicates a component-to-component variation as well as a variation of the D/H\nratio in the LISM, neither of which are supported by the newer STIS data. We\nbelieve the most probable cause for this difference is the characterization of\nthe background due to scattered light in the GHRS and STIS spectrographs. The\ntwo-dimensional MAMA detectors of STIS measure both the spatial and wavelength\ndependences of scattered light, allowing more accurate scattered light\ncorrections than was possible with GHRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 1999 16:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

With a simple model for the two-pion quark and gluon distribution\namplitudes we have estimated that the NLO effects may reduce the leading-order\namplitude by as much as 30%. We have found that besides the usual twist-2 quark\nand gluon operators the NLO amplitude receives contribution from a distribution\nassociated with twist-2 tensor gluon operator. The new gluon distribution can\nbe investigated by studying the azimuthal asymmetry of the cross section for\n$e+\\gamma\\to e'+\\pi\\pi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 1999 15:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 1999 11:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 1999 11:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We implement a\nnumerical scheme that renormalizes the solution each time that the average size\nof the empty region reduces by a half. The initial condition is a function with\ncircular level sets distorted with a small sinusoidal perturbation of wave\nnumber $k\\geq 3$. We find that for nonlinearity exponents m smaller than a\ncritical value which depends on k, the solution tends to a self-similar regime,\ncharacterized by rounded polygonal interfaces and similarity exponents that\ndepend on m and on the discrete rotational symmetry number k. For m greater\nthan the critical value, the final form of the interface is circular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 1999 20:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
