These solutions lead to integrable one-dimensional spin-chain\nHamiltonians. Here fusion is shown to generalize naturally to non-additive\nR-matrices, which therefore do not have a quantum group symmetry. This method\nis then applied to the generalized Hubbard models. Although the resulting\nintegrable models are not as simple as the starting ones, the general structure\nis that of two spin-(s times s') sl(2) models coupled at the free-fermion\npoint. An important issue is the probable lack of regular points which give\nlocal Hamiltonians. This problem is related to the existence of second order\nzeroes in the unitarity equation, and arises for the XX models of higher spins,\nthe building blocks of the Hubbard models. A possible connection between some\nLax operators L and R-matrices is noted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 1999 22:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 1999 16:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
