I investigate the\ncosmological consequences of such a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming\nan exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally\nequivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with power-law potential. I evaluate the\ndensity perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy\ndistribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the\ncomparison with observational data.\n  A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar\nfield has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as\n$\\phi $MDE, is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled\nquintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at\nlarge angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and\nthe present 8Mpc$/h$ density variance is diminished.

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}.
