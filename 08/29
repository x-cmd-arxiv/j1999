The concept is inherently configured to actively compensate the\nlongitudinal and transverse space charge expansion in beam bunches. These are\nbased on (1) actively varying the bunch acceleration equilibrium phase while\nmaintaining isochronism, independently for each cyclotron turns; (2)\nindependently changing the acceleration voltage for each turn together with\norbit corrections that preserve isochronism; (3) independently changing the\ntransverse betatron oscillation tune shift, to assure non-resonant operation.\nAlso, (4) sextupole lenses are included to compensate for chromaticity effects.\nMoreover, the concept is based on optimum uses of practical successful results\nso far achieved in beam acceleration and storage techniques.
