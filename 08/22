While the metallicity\ndepletion in dwarf galaxies can be explained in general by supernova-driven\ngalactic winds, the reason for their low N/O ratios at low O abundance is not\nyet completely understood. Stellar yields enrich the different gas phases with\nelements that are characteristic for their stellar progenitors. Gas-phase\ntransitions are necessary for a mixing of elements, but depend sensitively on\nthe thermal and dynamical state of the interstellar medium. Models of chemical\nevolution start usually with a high N/O ratio at low O abundance according to a\nmetal enrichment by ancient stellar populations with traditional yields, but\ncan only reproduce the N/O-O peculiarity by the stepwise element release and\nmostly by the application of multiple starbursts in order to account also for a\nselective element reduction by galactic winds. Chemodynamical models of dwarf\ngalaxies, however, demonstrate that strong evaporation of clouds by the hot\nsupernova gas leads to an almost perfect mixing of the interstellar gas and a\nlarge-scale homogenization of abundance ratios. In addition, even with\nstar-formation self-regulation these models can successfully account for the\nobserved N/O-O values in a self-consistent way. Although new stellar yields\nhave been taken into account which provide mainly secondary N production from\nmassive stars, a significant discrepancy remains between the chemodynamical\ndwarf galaxy models and closed-box models that take the chemodynamical\ntreatment into account. In this paper we therefore discuss to what amount gas\ninfall is responsible to affect the N/O ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 1999 17:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This study investigates a complete sample of 25 nearby (z\nless than 0.06) radio galaxies which are not cataloged members of Abell\nclusters. The environment of these radio galaxies is studied in both the X-ray\nand the optical by means of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), ROSAT pointed\nobservations, and the Palomar optical Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). X-ray\nluminosities and extents are determined from the RASS, and the DSS is used to\nquantify the degree of clustering via the spatial two-point correlation\ncoefficient, Bgg. Of the 25 sources, 20 are greater than sigma detections in\nthe X-ray and 11 possessed Bgg's significantly in excess of that expected for\nan isolated galaxy. Adding the criterion that the X-ray emission be resolved,\n10 of the radio galaxies do appear to reside in poor clusters with extended\nX-ray emission suggestive of the presence of an intracluster medium. Eight of\nthese galaxies also possess high spatial correlation coefficients. Taken\ntogether, these data suggest that the radio galaxies reside in a low richness\nextension of the Abell clusters. The unresolved X-ray emission from the other\ngalaxies is most likely associated with AGN phenomena. Furthermore, although\nthe sample size is small, it appears that the environments of FR I and FR II\nsources differ. FR I's tend to be more frequently associated with extended\nX-ray emission (10 of 18), whereas FR II's are typically point sources or\nnon-detections in the X-ray (none of the 7 sources exhibit extended X-ray\nemission).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 1999 19:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The condensate and normal gas are\nstudied by two-photon spectroscopy of the 1S-2S transition. We condense over\n10^9 atoms per second for several seconds, and the peak condensate density is\naround 5x10^15 cm^-3. Topics covered in the thesis include a theoretical\nanalysis of Bose-condensed hydrogen, a description of the cryogenic trapping\ncell and the evaporative cooling techniques used to bring the gas to the\ncondensation point, and an analysis of the condensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 1999 04:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The emerging proposal is then to see the cosmic system as a\nSteady Open System, state that is continually exchanging energy, matter and\ninformation, and in it Dark gravity bodies can be seen as gravity compensators\nof the whole system. But then appear new forces when the whole system is\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 1999 12:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
