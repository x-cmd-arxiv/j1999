The relation accounts for radial character\nof redshift distortions, and it is not restricted to the limit of the distant\nobserver. Direct comparisons between the observed redshift-space density fields\nand the real-space velocity fields possess all of the advantages of the\nconventional redshift-space analyses, while at the same time they are free of\ntheir disadvantages. In particular, neither the model-dependent reconstruction\nof the density field in real space is necessary, nor is the reconstruction of\nthe nonlinear velocity field in redshift space, questionable because of its\nvorticity at second order. The nonlinear redshift-space velocity field is\nirrotational only in the distant observer limit, and that limit is not a good\napproximation for shallow catalogs of peculiar velocities currently available.\nUnlike the conventional redshift-space comparisons, the comparison proposed\nhere does not have to be restricted to the linear regime. Accounting for\nnonlinear effects removes one of the sources of bias in the estimate of beta.\nMoreover, the nonlinear effects break the Omega-bias degeneracy plaguing all\nanalyses based on linear theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 1999 15:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2000 11:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
