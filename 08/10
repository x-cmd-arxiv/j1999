If so then physical\ncollisions between clouds must occur; these cause strong, radiative shocks to\npropagate through the cold gas, with the startling implication that all\n``dark'' halos must be luminous. The expected luminosity is a strong function\nof halo velocity dispersion, and should contribute a significant fraction of\nthe observed X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies, if dark halos are\npredominantly made of cold gas.\n  Existing data do not exclude this possibility; indeed two particular\nexpectations of the luminous-halo model are borne out in the X-ray data, and\nthus give support to the cold-cloud dark matter model. First we find a\nluminosity-temperature correlation of the form L proportional to T to the power\n11/4, as seen in recent analyses of cluster samples. Secondly the anticipated\nspectra have substantially more power at low energies than isothermal\nbremsstrahlung spectra, and might account for the observed ``excess'' EUV\nemission seen from some clusters. The successes of the luminous-halo model are\nparticularly remarkable because the theory has no free parameters or ad hoc\nelements. The model can be tested by the X-ray satellite Chandra, which should\nresolve the Virgo cluster into 10,000 point-like, transient X-ray sources.\nNon-detection of any such sources by Chandra can constrain the contribution of\ncold gas clouds to below 1% of the total matter density in the Universe,\nassuming Virgo to be representative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 1999 05:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2000 01:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that Bousso's entropy bound can be derived from\neither of two sets of hypotheses. The first set of hypotheses is (i) associated\nwith each null surface L in spacetime there is an entropy flux 4-vector s^a_L\nwhose integral over L is the entropy flux through L, and (ii) along each null\ngeodesic generator of L, we have $|s^a_L k_a| \\le \\pi (\\lambda_\\infty -\n\\lambda) T_{ab} k^a k^b$, where $T_{ab}$ is the stress-energy tensor, $\\lambda$\nis an affine parameter, $k^a = (d / d\\lambda)^a$, and $\\lambda_\\infty$ is the\nvalue of affine parameter at the endpoint of the geodesic. The second (purely\nlocal) set of hypotheses is (i) there exists an absolute entropy flux 4-vector\ns^a such that the entropy flux through any null surface L is the integral of\ns^a over L, and (ii) this entropy flux 4-vector obeys the pointwise\ninequalities $(s_a k^a)^2 \\le T_{ab} k^a k^b / (16 \\pi)$ and $|k^a k^b \\nabla_a\ns_b| \\le \\pi T_{ab} k^a k^b /4$ for any null vector k^a. Under the first set of\nhypotheses, we also show that a stronger entropy bound can be derived, which\ndirectly implies the generalized second law of thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 1999 17:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 1999 19:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 1999 18:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Feb 2000 22:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is based on\napproximation of the solution to find in the form of superposition of certain\npolynomial- exponential basic functions. The method is studied for the\nHelmholtz equation in comparison with the standard finite difference method.\nThe numerical tests have shown the convergence of the method proposed. In\ncomparison with the finite difference method the same accuracy is obtained on\nsubstantially rarer mesh. This advantage becomes more pronounced, if the\nsolution varies very rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 1999 11:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, it is explained how the\ncontextuality property (which is a necessary consistency condition of all\ncausal subquantum theories) naturally appears within the framework of certain\nC*-algebraic extensions of the quantum observables algebras. Furthermore, a\nquestion of locality is discussed. It is explained that the appropriate\nnon-Kolmogorovian probability theory allows us to unify both locality and\ncausality with the principles of quantum mechanics, overcoming the obstacles\ngiven by Bell's inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 1999 01:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
