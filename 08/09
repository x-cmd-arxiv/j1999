In spite of the lack of any distinct cutoff-like\nfeature in the spectra of Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 (in the interval 0.26-10 TeV)\nwhich could clearly indicate the presence of such a photon absorption\nmechanism, we demonstrate that strong EBL attenuation signal (survival\nprobability of 10 TeV photon <10^{-2}) may still be present in the spectra of\nthese AGNs. By estimating the minimal and maximal opacity of the universe to\nTeV gamma-ray photons, we calculate the visibility range for current and future\ngamma-ray observatories. Finally, we show that the proposed experiments,\nVERITAS, HESS, and MAGIC, may even be able to actually measure the EBL SED\nbecause their observations extend to the critical 75-150 GeV regime. In this\ntransition region a distinct ``knee-like'' feature should exist in the spectra\nof blazars, which is invariant with respect to their intrinsic properties. The\nchange of the spectral index and flux amplitude across this knee, if observed\nfor several blazars, will provide missing pieces of information needed to\nmeasure EBL in the wavelength range 0.1-30 $\\mu$m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 1999 01:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-03"}
