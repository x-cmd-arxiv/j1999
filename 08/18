Accretion is induced by the\naddition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by\na function \\nu. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of \\nu\nare varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of\nmagnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial\nscales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant\noutward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by, and a large\nfraction of the mass participating in, the accretion flow. Although the\ninstantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective\neddies, long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable\ncorrespondence to certain steady-state solutions. Near the equatorial plane,\nthe radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power-laws with an index\nthat depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. We find that regardless\nof the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear\nstress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and\nis everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion\nrate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied\nto the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate\nassociated with the flow properties near the central object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 1999 19:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This effort has been triggered by an unusual\ncross-fertilization between theory and experiments. In this paper, the main\nexperimental results obtained in the context of ladders are reviewed from the\nperspective of a theorist. Emphasis is given to the many similarities between\nthe two-dimensional high-$\\rm T_c$ cuprates and the two-leg ladder compounds,\nincluding Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ (14-24-41) which has a\nsuperconducting phase at high pressure and a small hole density. Examples of\nthese similarities include regimes of linear resistivity vs temperature in\nmetallic ladders and a normal state with spin-gap or pseudogap characteristics.\nSome controversial results in this context are also discussed. It is remarked\nthat the ladder 14-24-41 is the first superconducting copper-oxide material\nwith a non-square-lattice layered arrangement, and certainly much can be\nlearned from a careful analysis of this compound. A short summary of the main\ntheoretical developments in this field is also included, as well as a brief\ndescription of the properties of non-copper-oxide ladders. Suggestions by the\nauthor on possible experiments are described in the text. Overall, it is\nconcluded that the enormous experimental effort carried out on ladders has\nalready unveiled quite challenging and interesting physics that adds to the\nrich behavior of electrons in transition-metal-oxides, and in addition\ncontributes to the understanding of the two-dimensional cuprates.

This approach introduces\nan entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able\nto achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will,\nwhen pursued by those agents, result in high world utility?

Reproducing the residue ensures that the tail of the deuteron\nwave function, which is directly related to NN scattering data via analytic\ncontinuation, is correctly reproduced in the EFT at next-to-leading order. The\nrole of multi-nucleon-electroweak operators which produce deviations from\neffective-range theory can then be explicitly separated from the physics of the\nwave function tail. Such an operator contributes to the deuteron quadrupole\nmoment, mu_Q, at low order, indicating a sensitivity to short-distance physics.\nThis is consistent with the failure of impulse approximation calculations in NN\npotential models to reproduce mu_Q. The convergence of NN phase shifts in the\nEFT is unimpaired by the use of this new expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 1999 21:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
