A radiation-hydrodynamical\noutflow associated with the flare could impart the required torque, but only if\nthe dipole magnetic field is stronger than ~ 10^14 G and the outflow lasts\nlonger and/or is more energetic than the observed X-ray flare. A positive\nperiod increment is also a natural consequence of a gradual, plastic\ndeformation of the neutron star crust by an intense magnetic field, which\nforces the neutron superfluid to rotate more slowly than the crust. Sudden\nunpinning of the neutron vortex lines during the August 27th event would then\ninduce a glitch opposite in sign to those observed in young pulsars, but of a\nmuch larger magnitude as a result of the slower rotation.\n  The change in the persistent X-ray lightcurve following the August 27 event\nis ascribed to continued particle heating in the active region of that\noutburst. The enhanced X-ray output can be powered by a steady current flowing\nthrough the magnetosphere, induced by the twisting motion of the crust. The\nlong term rate of spindown appears to be accelerated with respect to a simple\nmagnetic dipole torque. Accelerated spindown of a seismically-active magnetar\nwill occur when its persistent output of Alfven waves and particles exceeds its\nspindown luminosity. We suggest that SGRs experience some episodes of relative\ninactivity, with diminished spindown rates, and that such inactive magnetars\nare observed as Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). The rapid reappearence of\npersistent X-ray emission following August 27 flare gives evidence against\naccretion-powered models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 1999 08:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The present neutron scattering\nexperiments on the same x=0.05 crystal employ a narrower instrumental\nQ-resolution and thereby have revealed that the crystal has only two\northorhombic twins at low temperatures with relative populations of 2:1. We\nfind that, in a single twin, only two satellites are observed at (1, +/-0.064,\nL)(ortho) and (0, 1+/-0.064, L)(ortho), that is, the modulation vector is only\nalong the orthorhombic b*-axis.

Our\nanalysis suffers no divergence and so does not suffer from the manipulational\nobscurities in the conventional analysis of divergent integrals. Our main\nconclusions agree exactly with those of Ingermanson for D=1,2 but disagree for\nD=3: the D=3 sinh(sine)-Gordon model is non-trivial. Furthermore, our analysis\nshows that for D=1,2, the running coupling constant (RCC)has poles for\nsine-Gordon model($\\gamma^2<0$) and the sinh-Gordon model ($\\gamma^2>0$) has a\npossible critical point $\\gamma^2_c$ while for D=3, the RCC has poles for both\n$\\gamma^2>0$ and $\\gamma^2<0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 1999 11:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
