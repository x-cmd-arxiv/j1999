Namely, in addition to the\nstochastic guidance condition which describes how the wave controls the\nparticle (wave-to-particle guidance condition), we introduce another stochastic\nguidance condition describing how the particle guides the wave\n(particle-to-wave guidance condition). We therefore introduce an\naction-reaction principle in the pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics.\nThe particle-to-wave guidance condition takes the form of spontaneous\ntransitions of the wavefunction that are Poisson distributed in time. The\nwavefunction selected by the transition is influenced by its likelyhood with\nrespect to the particle position, as well as certain conservation constraints.\nIt is shown that the stochastic particle-to-wave guidance condition reproduces\ncertain aspects of the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini and\nWeber [G.
