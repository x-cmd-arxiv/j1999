A change of Z influences the central helium burning and,\nconsequently, the size of the C/O core which becomes a C/O white dwarf and its\nC/O ratio.

The gas in\nIRAS F23060+0505 is in dipolar rotation but with an asymmetric rotation curve\nand an increased FWHM on one side; an asymmetry to the narrow-line profiles is\nattributed to a spatially-resolved outflow, and shock+precursor ionization is\ndominant.

Some of these observations are related to the fact that\ntranslational and orientational degrees of freedom couple in nontrivial ways. A\nmodel system which can serve as a paradigm to understand these couplings is a\nsystem of hard ellipsoids of revolution. To test this we compare at the ideal\nglass transition the static molecular correlators of a linear A-B Lennard-Jones\nmolecule obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation with a selected fluid of\nhard ellipsoids for which the static correlators have been obtained using\nPercus-Yevick theory. We also demonstrate that the critical non-ergodicity\nparameters obtained from molecular mode coupling theory for both systems show a\nremarkable similarity at the glass transition, provided the aspect ratio is\nchosen properly. Therefore we conclude that a system of hard ellipsoids can\nindeed be used to understand part of the essential behaviour of such a simple\nmolecular system like the A-B Lennard-Jones molecules in the vicinity of the\nideal glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 1999 11:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The variability of the speed of light is\nrepresented by the variability of the matter light-cone relative to the\ngravitational light-cone.

The dynamics of the field M is that of a SL(4,R)-sigma model gauged\nwith respect to local (orthochronous) Lorentz transformations on each of the\nbundles.

It is a good\napproximation to assume that (1) the binary star system is irrotational, i.e.\nthe vorticity of the flow field inside component stars vanishes everywhere\n(irrotational flow), and (2) the binary star system is in quasi-equilibrium,\nfor an inspiraling binary neutron star system just before the coalescence as a\nresult of gravitational wave emission. We can introduce the velocity potential\nfor such an irrotational flow field, which satisfies an elliptic partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) with a Neumann type boundary condition at the\nstellar surface. For a treatment of general relativistic gravity, we use the\nWilson--Mathews formulation, which assumes conformal flatness for spatial\ncomponents of metric. In this formulation, the basic equations are expressed by\na system of elliptic PDEs. We have developed a method to solve these PDEs with\nappropriate boundary conditions. The method is based on the established\nprescription for computing equilibrium states of rapidly rotating axisymmetric\nneutron stars or Newtonian binary systems. We have checked the reliability of\nour new code by comparing our results with those of other computations\navailable. We have also performed several convergence tests. By using this\ncode, we have obtained quasi-equilibrium sequences of irrotational binary star\nsystems with strong gravity as models for final states of real evolution of\nbinary neutron star systems just before coalescence.

Then I discuss\nspontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD, which implies that at low\nmomenta there must be quasiparticles - constituent quarks with dynamical mass,\nwhich should be coupled to other quasiparticles - Goldstone bosons. Then it is\nnatural to assume that in the low-energy regime the underlying dynamics in\nbaryons is due to Goldstone boson exchange (GBE) between constituent quarks.\nUsing as a prototype of the microscopical quark-gluon degrees of freedom the\ninstanton-induced 't Hooft interaction I show why the GBE is so important. When\nthe 't Hooft interaction is iterated in the qq t-channel it inevitably leads to\na pole which corresponds to GBE. This is a typical antiscreening behavior: the\ninteraction is represented by a bare vertex at large momenta, but it blows up\nat small momenta in the channel with GBE quantum numbers, explaining thus a\ndistinguished role of the latter interaction in the low-energy regime. I show\nhow the explicitly flavour-dependent short-range part of the GBE interaction\nbetween quarks, perhaps in combination with the vector-meson exchange\ninteraction, solves a key problem of baryon spectroscopy and present spectra\nobtained in a simple analytical calculation as well as in exact\nsemirelativistic three-body approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 1999 04:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These pieces were obtained by considering the relative polar\nvarieties of L\\^e and Teissier as gap sheaves. A gap sheaf is a formal device\nwhich gives a scheme-theoretic meaning to the analytic closure of the\ndifference of an initial scheme and an analytic set. We would like to extend\nour results on L\\^e cycles to functions on an arbitrary complex analytic space,\nand so we generalize this algebraic approach.\n  We begin with an ordered set of generators for an ideal, and produce a\ncollection of pure-dimensional analytic cycles, the Vogel cycles, which seem to\ncontain a great deal of ``geometric'' data related to the original ideal. We\nprove a number of useful results, including some extremely general\nL\\^e-Iomdine-Vogel formulas; these formulas generalize the L\\^e Iomdine\nformulas that we used so profitably in previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 1999 18:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
