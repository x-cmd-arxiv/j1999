We consider two\ntypes of flows. In the first, small cool spots are formed on the surface of\nslowly rotating AGB stars. During the last AGB phase when mass loss rate is\nhigh, the dust shields the region above it from the stellar radiation. This\nleads to both further dust formation in the shaded region, and the convergence\nof the stream toward the shaded region. A concentration of magnetic cool spots\ntoward the equator will lead to a density contrast of up to a few between the\nequatorial and polar directions. This process can explain the positive\ncorrelation between high mass loss rate and a larger departure from sphericity\nin progenitors of elliptical planetary nebulae. In the second type of flow, the\nhigh density in the equatorial plane is formed by a binary interaction, where\nthe secondary star is close to, but outside the AGB envelope. The shielding of\nthe radiation by dust results in a very slow and dense flow in the equatorial\nplane. We suggest this flow as an alternative explanation for the equatorial\ndense matter found at several hundred astronomical units around several\npost-AGB binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 1999 20:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The typical timescale of\nthe phase change of an interstellar gas is $\\sim 10^7$--$10^8$ yr in spiral\ngalaxies. Since the phase transition changes the filling factor of the cold gas\nwhere the dust growth occurs, the dust growth rate varies on that timescale. In\norder to examine the response of the dust-to-gas ratio to the phase transition,\nwe construct a model of the time evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio. We adopt\nthe three phase model for the interstellar gas and the Ikeuchi-Tomita model for\nthe mass exchange among the phases. According to the model, three types of\nsolutions are possible: [1] all the gas is transformed to a hot gas; [2] a\nstable stationary state of three phases is realized; [3] the filling factor of\neach phase cyclically changes. For each of the three types of solutions, the\ndust-to-gas ratio behaves as follows: [1] almost all the dust is destroyed (the\ndust-to-gas ratio becomes $\\sim 0$); [2] the dust-to-gas ratio converges to a\nstationary state; [3] the dust-to-gas ratio varies cyclically in response to\nthe phase transition. In the case of [3], the amplitude of the variation of the\ndust-to-gas ratio is large (nearly an order of magnitude) if the dust growth\ntimescale is shorter than the phase transition timescale. This condition is\neasily satisfied in spiral galaxies.

Our work was stimulated by recent\nexperiments for SF_6 adsorbed in a mesoporous glass which showed the striking\nphenomenon of critical depletion, i.e. the adsorption excess \"Gamma\" first\nincreases but then decreases very rapidly to negative values as the bulk\ncritical temperature T_c is approached from above along near-critical\nisochores. By contrast, our density functional and simulation results, for a\nrange of strongly attractive wall-fluid potentials, show Gamma monotonically\nincreasing and eventually saturating as the temperature is lowered towards T_c\nalong both the critical (rho=rho_c) and sub-critical isochores (rho<\\rho_c).\nSuch behaviour results from the increasingly slow decay of the density profile\naway from the walls, into the middle of the slit, as T->T_c. For rho < rho_c we\nfind that in the fluid the effective bulk field, which is negative and which\nfavours desorption, is insufficient to dominate the effects of the surface\nfields which favour adsorption. We compare this situation with earlier results\nfor the lattice gas model with a constant (negative) bulk field where critical\ndepletion was found. Qualitatively different behaviour of the density profiles\nand adsorption is found in simulations for intermediate and weakly attractive\nwall-fluid potentials but in no case do we observe the critical depletion found\nin experiments. We conclude that the latter cannot be accounted for by a single\npore model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 1999 12:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We dwell on\nthe topological interpretation of helicity as related to the linking of field\nlines of the vorticity field. Earlier works failed to fully implement this\ninterpretation for cosmic strings by missing a term connected with the linking\nof these lines inside the strings. As a result paradoxical conclusions were\ndrawn: global cosmic string loops may not take on certain simple shapes, and\nbaryon number is not quantized in integers in the presence of local cosmic\nstrings in gauge theory. We show that both paradoxes are removed when internal\ncontributions to helicity are properly taken into account. In particular,\nquantization of baryon number can be understood within a special case of the\nGlashow-Weinberg-Salam model if cosmic strings are the unique mechanism for\nbaryosynthesis. In addition, we find a new constraint on the permitted linkages\nof cosmic strings in a string tangle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 1999 08:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The analogous question of cobordism classification with stricter\nconditions on Z/p-action was answered by Conner and Floyd.
