These amplitudes are calculated making use of the lowest order\nChiral Perturbation Theory (\\chiPT) Lagrangians and the exchanges of resonances\ncompatible with Chiral Symmetry as given in. On the other hand the large N_c\nconsiderations allow us to distinguish between elementary (as elementary as the\npions, for instance) and compound (meson-meson) states. Making use of this\nformalism one observes that the \\sigma, \\kappa and a_0(980) resonances are\nmeson-meson states originating from the unitarization of the lowest order\n\\chiPT amplitudes. On the other hand, the f_0(980) is a combination of a strong\nS-wave meson-meson unitarity effect and of a preexisting singlet resonance with\na mass around 1 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 1999 08:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Systems which contain large numbers of motors such as\nmuscles and flagella motivate the study of many interacting motors within the\nframework of simple models.
