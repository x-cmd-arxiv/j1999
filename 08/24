In the first step, the core collapse of a star with mass $\\ge\n19M_\\odot$ leads to a massive neutron star and a normal supernova, and\nsubsequently hypercritical accretion of the neutron star from the supernova\nejecta may give rise to a jet through neutrino annihilation and/or Poynting\nflux along the stellar rotation axis. However, because of too much surrounding\nmatter, this jet rapidly enters a nonrelativistic phase and evolves to a large\nbubble. In the second step, the neutron star promptly implodes to a rapidly\nrotating black hole surrounded by a torus when the mass of the star increases\nto the maximum mass and meanwhile its rotation frequency increases to the upper\nlimit due to the accreted angular momentum. The gravitational binding energy of\nthe torus may be dissipated by a magnetized relativistic wind, which may then\nbe absorbed by the supernova ejecta, thus producing an energetic hypernova. The\nrotational energy of the black hole may be extracted by the Blandford-Znajek's\nmechanism, leading to another jet. This jet is relatively free of baryons and\nthus may be accelerated to an ultrarelativistic phase because the first jet has\npushed out of its front matter and left a baryon-free exit. We expect that the\nsecond jet generates a GRB and its afterglow. Our two-step model may alleviate\nthe baryon-contamination problem suffered possibly from in the hypernova\nmodels. Furthermore, this model not only accounts for association of several\nGRBs with supernovae but also explains well the features of the afterglows of\nthese bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 1999 16:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 1999 02:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We suggest possible\nmicroscopic origins for charge trapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 1999 08:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A novel renormalization group (RG) method is developed\nwhich allows to study perturbatively the glassy low temperature XY phase and\nthe transition at which frozen topological defects (vortices) proliferate. This\nRG approach is constructed both from the replicated Coulomb gas and,\nequivalently without the use of replicas, using the probability distribution of\nthe local disorder (random defect core energy). By taking into account the\nfusion of environments (i.e charge fusion in the replicated Coulomb gas) this\ndistribution is shown to obey a Kolmogorov's type (KPP) non linear RG equation\nwhich admits travelling wave solutions and exhibits a freezing phenomenon\nanalogous to glassy freezing in Derrida's random energy models. The resulting\nphysical picture is that the distribution of local disorder becomes broad below\na freezing temperature and that the transition is controlled by rare favorable\nregions for the defects, the density of which can be used as the new\nperturbative parameter. The determination of marginal directions at the\ndisorder induced transition is shown to be related to the well studied front\nvelocity selection problem in the KPP equation and the universality of the\nnovel critical behaviour obtained here to the known universality of the\ncorrections to the front velocity.

A\nuseful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the ``relative\nCasimir energy\", which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting\nboundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the difference of Casimir energies between\nthe given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely\nfar apart. Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir\nenergy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a\nsimple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative\nCasimir entropy\", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in\nthe classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the\ngeometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of\nthe boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a\ndimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions\nto the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected\ncomponent of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from\nthe behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to\nour difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical\nquantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected\ncomponents of the boundary in a well defined manner.

It is inspired by the recent progress in the chiral\nfermions on the lattice. The wall \"height\" is given by 1/M, where M is a\nregularization mass parameter and appears as a 1+d dim Dirac fermion mass. The\npresent approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall or the overlap\nformalism in the lattice field theory. We will show qualitative correspondence\nbetween the present continuum results and those of the lattice. The extra\ndimension is regarded as the (inverse) temperature t. The domains are defined\nby the directions of the \"system movement\", not by the sign of M as in the\noriginal overlap formalism. Physically the parameter M controls both the\nchirality selection and the dimensional reduction to d dimension. From the\npoint of regularization, the limit $Mt\\ra 0$ regularize the infra-red behaviour\nwhereas the condition on the momentum ($k^\\m$) integral, $|k^\\m|\\leq M$,\nregularize the ultra-violet behaviour.\n  To check the new regularization works correctly, we take the 4 dim QED and 2\ndim chiral gauge theory as examples. Especially the consistent and covariant\nanomalies are correctly obtained. The choice of solutions of the higher dim\nDirac equation characterize the two anomalies. The projective properties of the\npositive and negative energy free solutions are exploited in calculation.

Thus, although the m=4 cat\nstate can be prepared from bipartite EPR states, the preparation process is\nnecessarily irreversible, and remains so even asymptotically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 1999 03:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 1999 20:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2000 22:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

We note that if such a UQTM really\nexists, with the program state dependent on the data state, and if the\nprescribed halting scheme is indeed valid, then there would be no entanglement\nbetween the halt qubit and other qubits, as pointed out by Myers. If, however,\nthe program is required to be independent of the data, the concerned\nentanglement appears, and is problematic no matter whether the halt qubit is\nmonitored or not. We also note that for a deterministic programmable quantum\ngate array, as discussed by Nielson and Chuang, if the program is allowed to\ndepend on the data state, then its existence has not been ruled out. On the\nother hand, if UQTM exists, it can be simulated by repeating the operation of a\nfixed gate array.

The main aspects of this extension are: One assumes a\nhyperparameter space $\\Phi$ common to several potential experiments, and a\nbasic symmetry group G associated with this space. The parameter \\theta_{a} of\na single experiment, looked upon as a parametric function $\\theta_{a}(\\cdot)$\non $\\Phi$, is said to be permissible if G induces in a natural way a new group\non the image space of the function. If this is not the case, it is arranged for\nby changing from G to a subgroup $G_{a}$. The Haar measure of this subgroup\n(confined to the spectrum; see below) is the prefered prior when the parameter\nis unknown. It is assumed that the hyperparameter itself can never be\nestimated, only a set of parametric functions. Model reduction is made by\nrestricting the space of complex `wave' functions, also regarded as functions\non $\\Phi$, to an irreducible invariant subspace $\\mathcal{M}$ under G. The\nspectrum of a parametric function is defined from natural group-theoretical and\nstatistical considerations. We establish that a unique operator can be\nassociated with every parametric functions $\\theta_{a}(\\cdot)$, and essentially\nall of the ordinary quantum theory formalism can be retrieved from these and a\nfew related assumptions. In particular the concept of spectrum is consistent.\nThe scope of the theory is illustrated on the one hand by the example of a spin\n1/2 particle and a related EPR discussion, on the other hand by a simple\nmacroscopic example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 1999 11:30:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 09:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}
