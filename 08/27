We show that the quantum wire can be charged positively or negatively\nor remain neutral as a whole, depending on such factors as the wire radius and\nthe background charge density in the wire. The magnitude of the charge and its\nsign are to a large extent determined by the exchange interaction of the\nelectrons in the wire.

The linear\nconductance is investigated as a function of the chemical potential. The\nnonadiabatic transition from the reservoirs to the wire leads to conductance\noscillations caused by multiple scattering of electron waves. The period of the\noscillations depends on the charge acquired by the wire and the exchange\nenergy. We find that the exchange interaction strongly enhances the Friedel\noscillations near the contacts.

Already the quantization of a particle on a circle shows\nthat the standard procedure has to be supplemented by an additional condition\non the admissibility of group actions. A systematic strategy for finding\nadmissible group actions for particular subbundles of cotangent spaces is\ndeveloped, two-dimensional prototypes of which are T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+\n(interpreted as restrictions of T^*R and T^*S^1 to positive coordinate and\nmomentum, respectively). In this framework (and under an additional, natural\ncondition) an SO_+(1,2)-action on S^1 x R^+ results as the unique admissible\ngroup action.\n  For symplectic manifolds which are (specific) parts of phase spaces with\nknown quantum theory a simple projection method of quantization is formulated.\nFor T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+ equivalent results to those of more established (but\nmore involved) quantization schemes are obtained. The approach may be of\ninterest, e.g., in attempts to quantize gravity theories where demanding\nnondegenerate metrics of a fixed signature imposes similar constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 1999 13:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 1999 13:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
