The binary radio pulsars PSR B1259-63 and PSR\nJ0045-73 are both in close eccentric orbits around bright main sequence stars\nwhich provide a huge density of low energy target photons. The inverse Compton\nscattering process transfers momentum from the pulsar wind to the scattered\nphotons, and therefore provides a drag which tends to decelerate the pulsar\nwind. We present detailed calculations of the dynamics of a pulsar wind which\nis undergoing inverse Compton scattering, showing that the deceleration of the\nwind of PSR B1259-63 due to `inverse Compton drag' is small, but that this\nprocess may confine the wind of PSR J0045-73 before it attains pressure balance\nwith the outflow of its companion star. We calculate the spectra and light\ncurves of the resulting inverse Compton emission from PSR B1259-63 and show\nthat if the size of the pulsar wind nebula is comparable to the binary\nseparation, then the gamma-ray emission from the unshocked wind may be\ndetectable by atmospheric Cerenkov detectors or by the new generation of\nsatellite-borne gamma-ray detectors such as INTEGRAL and GLAST.

As noticed by Cates and Ball (CB) there is a discrepancy between the\npredictions of the replica calculation of EM and the expectation that in an\ninfinite medium the quenched and annealed results should coincide (for a chain\nthat is free to move) and a long polymer should always collapse. CB argued that\nonly in a finite volume one might see a ``localization transition'' (or\ncrossover) from a stretched to a collapsed chain in three spatial dimensions.\nHere we carry out the replica calculation in the presence of an additional\nconfining harmonic potential that mimics the effect of a finite volume. Using a\nvariational scheme with five variational parameters we derive analytically for\nd<4 the result R~(g |ln \\mu|)^{-1/(4-d)} ~(g lnV)^{-1/(4-d)}, where R is the\nradius of gyration, g is the strength of the disorder, \\mu is the spring\nconstant associated with the confining potential and V is the associated\neffective volume of the system. Thus the EM result is recovered with their\nconstant replaced by ln(V) as argued by CB. We see that in the strict infinite\nvolume limit the polymer always collapses, but for finite volume a transition\nfrom a stretched to a collapsed form might be observed as a function of the\nstrength of the disorder. For d<2 and for large\nV>V'~exp[g^(2/(2-d))L^((4-d)/(2-d))] the annealed results are recovered and\nR~(Lg)^(1/(d-2)), where L is the length of the polymer. Hence the polymer also\ncollapses in the large L limit. The 1-step replica symmetry breaking solution\nis crucial for obtaining the above results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 1999 15:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

To make this possible, we use light-front field theory to\nisolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the Hamiltonian to\nforce its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the difference of\nthe free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a number of\nphysical principles of light-front pure-glue QCD, including Lorentz covariance\nand gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the Hamiltonian are not\nrequired to respect these physical principles. However, by requiring the\nHamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and by requiring\nit to respect the unviolated physical principles of pure-glue QCD, we are able\nto derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all orders in\nperturbation theory in terms of the running coupling.
