This follows a long hiatus in the application of\nsuprathermal ion bremsstrahlung to astrophysical models since the early 1970s.\nThe potential importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to normal\nbremsstrahlung, i.e. where ions are at rest, hinges upon the underlying\nvelocity distributions of the interacting species. In this paper, we identify\nthe conditions under which the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity is significant\nrelative to that for normal bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas. We\ndetermine that, since both observational and theoretical evidence favors\nelectron temperatures almost comparable to, and certainly not very deficient\nrelative to proton temperatures in shocked plasmas, these environments\ngenerally render inverse bremsstrahlung at best a minor contributor to the\noverall emission. Hence inverse bremsstrahlung can be safely neglected in most\nmodels invoking shock acceleration in discrete sources such as supernova\nremnants. However, on scales > 100pc distant from these sources, Coulomb\ncollisional losses can deplete the cosmic ray electrons, rendering inverse\nbremsstrahlung, and perhaps bremsstrahlung from knock-on electrons, possibly\ndetectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 1999 17:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The most natural algebraic starting point is the F-algebra,\nwhich is the de Sitter-type (10,2) extension of the super-Poincare algebra. We\nderive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and evaluate the\ntransformations of the associated gauge fields under the action of an\ninfinitesimal group element. We then discuss the formation of locally\nsupersymmetric actions using these quantities. Due to the absence of any\nvielbein terms there is no obvious way to define spacetime as such. In\naddition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an action\nwhich is linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. We consider the\nimplications of the simplest possible quadratic theories. We then investigate\nthe relationship between the twelve dimensional theories and Lorentz signature\ntheories in lower dimensions. We argue that in this context the process of\ndimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction.\nUpon contraction a regular spacetime emerges and we find that the twelve\ndimensional curvature constraint reduces to an Einstein-type equation in which\na quadratic non-linearity in the Ricci scalar is suppressed by a factor of the\nsame magnitude as the cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the degrees of\nfreedom of multi-temporal variables and their relation to ultra-hyperbolic wave\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 1999 15:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 1999 08:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a result, the thermal correction to resistance measured exists at\n$I\\to 0$. The correction should be in comparison with ohmic resistance. Above\nsome critical frequency dependent on thermal inertial effects the thermal\ncorrection disappears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 1999 11:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 1999 14:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

This measure increases when on the fixed state acts a Gaussian noise\nmap i.e. the selected state becomes closer to the classical states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 1999 08:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
