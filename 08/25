Earlier views were of rapid, early collapse and formation of basic\nstructures, followed by slow evolution of the stellar populations and steady\nbuildup of the chemical elements. Current theories emphasize hierarchical\nbuildup via recurrent collisions and mergers, separated by long periods of\nrelaxation and secular restructuring. Thus, collisions between galaxies are now\nseen as a primary process in their evolution. This article begins with a brief\nhistory; we then tour parts of the vast array of collisional forms that have\nbeen discovered to date. Many examples are provided to illustrate how detailed\nnumerical models and multiwaveband observations have allowed the general\nchronological sequence of collisional morphologies to be deciphered, and how\nthese forms are produced by the processes of tidal kinematics, hypersonic gas\ndynamics, collective dynamical friction and violent relaxation. Galaxy\ncollisions may trigger the formation of a large fraction of all the stars ever\nformed, and play a key role in fueling active galactic nuclei. Current\nunderstanding of the processes involved is reviewed.

The issue of projectability of these symmetries from tangent space\nto phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical interpretation of\nthe projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the Noether\nconserved quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form defined on it.\nWe also examine the enlarged formalism that results from taking the Lagrange\nmultipliers as new dynamical variables; we find the equation that characterizes\nthe Noether symmetries in this formalism. The algebra of generators for Noether\nsymmetries is discussed in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. We\nfind that a frequent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact\nthat the transformations of momenta in phase space and tangent space only\ncoincide on shell. Our results apply with no distinction to rigid and gauge\nsymmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of Noether\ngauge symmetries for theories with first and second class constraints that do\nnot exhibit tertiary constraints in the stabilization algorithm. Among some\nexamples that illustrate our results, we study the Noether gauge symmetries of\nthe Abelian Chern-Simons theory in $2n+1$ dimensions.

A two-fold\npuzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k_1 = k_2 + k_3. First, the\nsupergravity calculation involves analytic continuation in the k_i variables to\ndefine the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and an infinite integral over\nAdS. Second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to mixing of the\nsingle-trace operators $tr X^k$ with protected multi-trace operators in the\nsame representation of SU(4). We show that the calculation of extremal\ncorrelators from supergravity is subject to the same subtlety of regularization\nknown for the 2-point functions, and we present a careful method which\njustifies the analytic continuation and shows that supergravity fields couple\nto single traces without admixture. We also study extremal n-point functions of\nchiral primary operators, and argue that Type IIB supergravity requires that\ntheir space-time form is a product of n-1 two-point functions (as in the free\nfield approximation) multiplied by a non-renormalized coefficient.

To make this possible, we use light-front\nfield theory to isolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the\nHamiltonian to force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the\ndifference of the free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a\nnumber of physical principles of light-front field theory, including Lorentz\ncovariance and gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the\nHamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles. However, by\nrequiring the Hamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and\nby requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we\nare able to derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all\norders in perturbation theory in terms of the fundamental parameters of the\nfield theory. We present two applications of this method. First we work in\nmassless phi-cubed theory in six dimensions. We derive the recursion relations\nthat determine the Hamiltonian and demonstrate how they are used by computing\nand analyzing some of its second- and third-order matrix elements.
