For example, the double aspect theory of information holds that\ninformation has a phenomenal aspect. How then do you get from phenomenal\ninformation to human consciousness? This paper proposes that an entity is\nconscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and\nintegrating it through closure, and second by maintaining dynamics at the edge\nof chaos through simultaneous processes of divergence and convergence. The\norigin of life through autocatalytic closure, and the origin of an\ninterconnected worldview through conceptual closure, induced phase transitions\nin the degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally\namplified. Divergence and convergence of cognitive information may involve\nphenomena observed in light e.g. focusing, interference, and resonance. By\nmaking information flow inward-biased, closure shields us from external\nconsciousness; thus the paucity of consciousness may be an illusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 1999 23:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2002 12:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The stratification, and\nin particular the large specific internal energy and slow flow in the shear\nlayer largely determines the emission from the jet. If the magnetic field in\nthe shear layer becomes helical (e.g., resulting from an initial toroidal field\nand an aligned field component generated by shear) the emission shows a cross\nsection asymmetry, in which either the top or the bottom of the jet dominates\nthe emission. This, as well as limb or spine brightening, is a function of the\nviewing angle and flow velocity, and the top/bottom jet emission predominance\ncan be reversed if the jet changes direction with respect to the observer, or\npresents a change in velocity. The asymmetry is more prominent in the polarized\nflux, because of field cancellation (or amplification) along the line of sight.\nRecent observations of jet cross section emission asymmetries in the blazar\n1055+018 can be explained assuming the existence of a shear layer with a\nhelical magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 1999 20:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These structures\nand motions are similar to what are commonly observed in weakly\nself-gravitating interstellar clouds, suggesting that these clouds get their\nfractal structures from non-linear magnetic waves generated in the intercloud\nmedium; no internal source of turbulent energy is necessary. The clumps in the\nsimulated clouds are slightly warmer than the interclump medium as a result of\nmagnetic dissipational and compressive heating.

How does this resonance affect the distribution function in the outer\nparts of a barred disk, and can we identify any effect of the resonance in the\nvelocity distribution f(v) actually observed in the solar neighborhood? To\nanswer these questions, detailed simulations of f(v) in the outer parts of an\nexponential stellar disks with nearly flat rotation curves and a rotating\ncentral bar have been performed. For a model resembling the old stellar disk,\nthe OLR causes a distinct feature in f(v) over a significant fraction of the\nouter disk. For positions <2kpc outside the OLR radius and at bar angles of\n\\~10-70 degrees, f(v) inhibits a bi-modality between the low-velocity stars\nmoving like the local standard of rest (LSR) and a secondary mode of stars\npredominantly moving outward and rotating more slowly than the LSR.\n  Such a bi-modality is indeed present in f(v) inferred from the Hipparcos data\nfor late-type stars in the solar neighborhood. If one interpretes this observed\nbi-modality as induced by the OLR -- and there are hardly any viable\nalternatives -- then one is forced to deduce that the OLR radius is slightly\nsmaller than Ro.

This constitutes the angular momentum problem of new-born stars.\nIn this paper, the angular momentum transfer in the contraction of a rotating\nmagnetized cloud is studied with axisymmetric MHD simulations. Owing to the\nlarge dynamic range covered by the nested-grid method, the structure of the\ncloud in the range from 10 AU to 0.1 pc is explored. First, the cloud\nexperiences a run-away collapse, and a disk forms perpendicularly to the\nmagnetic field, in which the central density increases greatly in a finite\ntime-scale. In this phase, the specific angular momentum j of the disk\ndecreases to $\\simeq 1/3$ of the initial cloud.

On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger\nthan 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the\nAdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always\nnegative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other\nwall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadow\nmatter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of a\nclustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated if\nnaively measured through its lensing effect.
