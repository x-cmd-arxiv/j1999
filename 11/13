A detailed investigation of the mid-UV features of elliptical galaxies\nmay help break the age-metallicity degeneracy that plagues optical techniques.\nAlso, a better understanding of this wavelength region is useful for the\nstudies of 0.5 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 1.5 galaxies for which the rest frame mid-UV is\nredshifted into the visible.

The PGBs could be\nproduced during the merging of two compact objects like two neutron stars or\nneutron star - black hole, and then decay into electron-positron pairs and\nphotons at distances ~ 100-1000 km. In this way, a huge energy (up to more than\n10^{54} erg) can be deposited into the outer space with low baryon density in\nthe form of ultrarelativistic e^+e^- plasma, the so called fireball, which\noriginates the observed gamma-ray bursts. The needed ranges for the PGB\nparameters are: mass of order MeV, coupling to nucleons g_{aN} ~ few x 10^{-6}\nand to electrons g_{ae} ~ few x 10^{-9}. Interestingly enough, the range for\ncoupling constants correspond to that of the invisible axion with the\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale V ~ few x 10^5 GeV, but the mass of the\nPGB is many orders of magnitude larger than what such a scale would demand to\nan axion.

Another exciting\npoint is that our mechanism could explain the association of some GRBs with\nsupernovae type Ib/c, as far as their progenitor stars have a radius ~ 10^4 km.\nAnd finally, it also could help the supernova type II explosion: PGBs emitted\nfrom the core of the collapsing star and decaying in the outer shells would\ndeposit a kinetic energy of the order of 10^{51} erg.

This leads to a\ndifferent equation for continuum dynamics, as compared with general relativity.\nFor a perfect fluid, this alternative dynamics predicts tenuous amounts of\nmatter production or destruction, by a reversible exchange with the\ngravitational field. This exchange is completely determined by the dynamical\nequation and the scalar equation of the gravitational field. In contrast, the\nusual equation for relativistic continuum dynamics allows matter production\nonly if some additional field is assumed, and the production rate must be\nphenomenologically postulated.
