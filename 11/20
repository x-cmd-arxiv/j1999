Of these,\nreduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational\nmorphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In\nthis paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology\nand morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of\nprosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical\nrepresentations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and\nalso to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource\nconsciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing\nbetween producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of\nreduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state\noperation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail\nto contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents\nimplemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German\nhypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate\nthe expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are\ndiscussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level\napproach to prosodic morphology presents an attractive way of extending\nfinite-state techniques to difficult phenomena that hitherto resisted elegant\ncomputational analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 1999 16:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nHamiltonian corresponds to a time-dependent mass (TM) Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith the restriction that there are only P^2 and X^2 terms. We give the\nspecific transformations to a different quantum Schr\\\"odinger(TQ) equation and\nto a different time-dependent oscillator (TO) equation. For each Schr\\\"odinger\nsystem, we give the Lie algebra of space-time symmetries and (x,t)\nrepresentations for number states, coherent states, and squeezed states. These\ngeneral results include earlier work as special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 1999 04:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2000 03:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2002 04:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
