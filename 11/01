When the dust grains\nare aligned, the anisotropy in the radiation makes various effects on the\npolarization of the thermal emission, depending on the relative angle between\nthe anisotropy and alignment directions. If the both directions are parallel,\nthe anisotropy produces a steep increase in the polarization degree at short\nwavelengths. If they are perpendicular, the polarization reversal occurs at a\nwavelength shorter than the emission peak. The effect of the anisotropic\nradiation will make a change of more than a few % in the polarization degree\nfor short wavelengths and the effect must be taken into account in the\ninterpretation of the polarization in the thermal emission. The anisotropy in\nthe radiation field produces a strong spectral dependence of the polarization\ndegree and position angle, which is not seen under isotropic radiation. The\ndependence changes with the grain shape to a detectable level and thus it will\nprovide a new tool to investigate the shape of dust grains.

The interpretation of these results\nin the context of von Neumann algebras provides some support to the conjecture\nof Connes on rigidity of group algebras for groups with property T. Our\nrigidity results also give examples of countable equivalence relations of type\nII, which cannot be generated (mod 0) by a free action of any group. This gives\na negative answer to a long standing problem of Feldman and Moore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 1999 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
