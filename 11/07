In the standard approach, the (analytically\ncontinued) harmonic oscillator paradigm is important in describing particle\nproduction. However, there is another gauge in which the particle production\nprocess has striking similarities with the one used to describe Hawking\nradiation in black holes. The gauge we use to describe the electric field in is\nthe lightcone gauge, so named because the mode functions for a scalar field are\nfound to be singular on the lightcone. We use these modes in evaluating the\neffective Lagrangian using the proper time technique. The key feature of this\nanalysis is that these modes can be explicitly \"normalized\" by using the\ncriterion that they reduce to the usual flat space modes in the limit of the\nelectric field tending to zero. We find that the proper time kernel is not the\nsame as the analytically continued oscillator kernel though the effective\nLagrangian is the standard result as it should be. We also consider an example\nof a confined electric field system using the lightcone gauge modes. Our\nanalysis indicates that the Bogolubov coefficients, in taking the limit to the\nuniform electric field case, are multiplied by energy dependent boundary\nfactors that have not been taken into account before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 1999 06:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Kochen-Specker theorem just points out\nthat it is impossible even conceive a hidden variable model in which the\noutcomes of all measurements are pre-determined; it does not matter if these\nmeasurements are performed or not, or even if these measurements can be\nachieved only with finite precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 1999 16:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A quantum\nkey distribution protocol based on this idea is described. The scheme exhibits\nthe following features. (a) It does not require that Alice and Bob choose\nbetween alternative measurements, therefore improving the rate of generated\nbits by transmitted qubit. (b) It allows Alice and Bob to generate a key of\narbitrary length using a single quantum system (three EPR pairs), instead of a\nlong sequence of them. (c) Detecting Eve requires the comparison of fewer bits.\n(d) Entanglement is an essential ingredient. The scheme assumes reliable\nmeasurements of the Bell operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 1999 16:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2000 20:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
