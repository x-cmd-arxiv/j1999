The spectrum is characterised by a thermal continuum which can be\nwell fit by a power-law S_nu ~ nu^0.99 over the entire SWS wavelength range.\nFor an isothermal disc of ionized gas with constant opening angle, this\ncorreponds to a density gradient rho(r) ~ r^(-2.8). We report the detection of\nthe Humphreys bound-free jump in emission at 3.4 micrometer. The size of the\njump is sensitive to the electron temperature of the gas in the disc, and we\nfind T~9000 K, i.e. much lower than the stellar effective temperature\n(25000-30000 K). The spectrum is dominated by numerous emission lines, mostly\nfrom HI, but also some HeI lines are detected. Several spectral features cannot\nbe identified. The line strengths of the HI{\\sc i} emission lines do not follow\ncase B recombination line theory. The line strengths and widths suggest that\nmany lines are optically thick and come from an inner, high density region with\nradius 3-5 R_star and temperature above that of the bulk of the disc material.\nOnly the alpha, beta and gamma transitions of the series lines contain a\ncontribution from the outer regions. The level populations deviate\nsignificantly from LTE and are highly influenced by the optically thick, local\n(disc) continuum radiation field. The inner disk may be rotating more rapidly\nthan the stellar photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 1999 14:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, such an approach cannot be employed to define `conserved\nquantities' in a situation where symplectic current can be radiated away (such\nas occurs at null infinity in general relativity) because there does not, in\ngeneral, exist a Hamiltonian which generates the given asymptotic symmetry.\n(This fact is closely related to the fact that the desired `conserved\nquantities' are not, in general, conserved!) In this paper we give a\nprescription for defining `conserved quantities' by proposing a modification of\nthe equation that must be satisfied by a Hamiltonian. Our prescription is a\nvery general one, and is applicable to a very general class of asymptotic\nconditions in arbitrary diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity derivable\nfrom a Lagrangian, although we have not investigated existence and uniqueness\nissues in the most general contexts.

The Casimir\nplates are two closely spaced, conductive plates, where an attractive force is\nobserved to exist between the plates called the 'Casimir Force'. We propose\nthat the velocity of light in a vacuum increases when propagating between two\ntransparent Casimir Plates. We call this effect the 'Light Velocity Casimir\nEffect' or LVC effect. The LVC effect happens because the vacuum energy density\nin between the plates is lower than that outside the Casimir plates. The\nconductive plates disallow certain frequencies of electrically charged virtual\nparticles to exist inside the plates, thus lowering the inside vacuum particle\ndensity, compared to the density outside the plates. The reduced (electrically\ncharged) virtual particle density results in fewer photon scattering events\ninside the plates, which should increase the light velocity between the plates\nin a vacuum relative to the normal vacuum light speed. A similar effect,\ninvolving light velocity change, occurs when light travels through two\ndifferent real material densities; for example when light propagates from water\nto air, a process known as optical refraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 1999 19:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
