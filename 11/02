We demonstrate that\nthis uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V\nand Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that\nthese systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to\na factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The\ninferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or\ngreater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests\nthe metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei,\nbut includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of\nSi IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in\nthe metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the\nvariation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty\nin the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the\ndecrement. Laboratory measurements of the relevant DR resonance strengths and\nenergies are the only unambiguous method to remove the effects of these atomic\nphysics uncertainties from models of the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 1999 18:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
