Three types of mixed states, OR, AND and a majority decision mixed\nstate are described as typical examples. Each element of the OR mixed state is\ncomposed of corresponding memory pattern elements by means of the OR-operation.\nThe other two types are similarly defined. By analyzing their stabilities\nthrough the SCSNA and the computer simulation, we found that the storage\ncapacity of the OR mixed state diverges in the sparse limit, but that the other\nstates do not diverge. In addition, we found that the optimal threshold values,\nwhich maximize the storage capacity, for the memory pattern and the OR mixed\nstate coincide with each other in the spare limit.

An orthogonal basis which spanned the time\nspace, ceases to be orthogonal and becomes overcomplete if the domain of\nfrequencies is restricted in a bandwidth. In this case there exists an infinite\nnumber of sub-bases of discrete times which are orthogonal and complete. The\nrelation between the overcomplete bases and a complete one is the essence of\nthe sampling theorem. The signal theory is reformulated in the framework of the\nDirac bra-kets. The case of signals existing for positive time is treated in\ndetail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 1999 17:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is demonstrated that\nfrom a empiric-physical point of view these assumptions are not given in the\ncase of inertial systems separated by very large distances. Analogous to the\nimpossibility to measure motion relative to absolute space, it turns out to be\nphysically non feasible to extend the coordinate system of any reference frame\nconsidered at rest relative to a distantly moving system for a direct\ncomparision of the coordinates, and vice versa. The extended Lorentz\ntransformation strictly based on first physical principles predicts the\npossibility of superluminal propagation of very distant material bodies and, in\nthis case, the generation of Cerenkov radiation out of the quantum vacuum.
