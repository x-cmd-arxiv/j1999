In the\nmean-field limit holding for fast communication we derive a critical population\nsize, above which the community separates into a majority and a minority with\nopposite opinions. The existence of external support (e.g. from mass media)\nchanges the ratio between minority and majority, until above a critical\nexternal support the supported subpopulation exists always as a majority.\nSpatial effects lead to two critical ``social'' temperatures, between which the\ncommunity exists in a metastable state, thus fluctuations below a certain\ncritical wave number may result in a spatial opinion separation. The range of\nmetastability is particularly determined by a parameter characterizing the\nindividual response to the communication field.
