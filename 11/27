The molecular gas in the\ninner 5'' is resolved into a ring with two bright knots east and west of the\nnuclear continuum emission. For the first time in NGC 1068, we can trace\nmolecular gas at ~0.18'' (13pc) from the nucleus. The high velocities in this\nregion imply an enclosed mass of ~10^8 M_solar.

Analysis of the rotation curve shows the CO spiral\narms are at the inner Lindblad resonance of this bar-like structure. Inside the\nmolecular spiral arms the CO kinematic axis changes direction probably in\nresponse to the 2.5kpc (deprojected) long stellar bar seen in the near infrared\n(NIR). The low velocity dispersion indicates the molecular gas is in a disk\nwith a thickness of 10pc in the nuclear region and 100pc in the spiral arms.\n  We constructed kinematic models for the molecular gas using elliptical orbits\ncaused by a ~1'' nuclear bar and using tilted rings resulting in a warp. We\nfind that the gas motions are consistent with either the warp or the bar\nmodels. However, because there is no evidence for a 1'' nuclear bar in NIR\nimages, we favor the warp model. A warped CO disk can also explain the\nobscuration of the AGN, the extinction of light from the nuclear stellar\ncluster, and the observed NIR and mid-IR polarization.

In this work, we analyze the cavitation\nthreshold for radially symmetric bubbles whose radii are slightly less than the\nBlake critical radius, in the presence of time-periodic acoustic pressure\nfields. A distinguished limit equation is derived that predicts the threshold\nfor cavitation for a wide range of liquid viscosities and forcing frequencies.\nThis equation also yields frequency-amplitude response curves. Moreover, for\nfixed liquid viscosity, our study identifies the frequency that yields the\nminimal forcing amplitude sufficient to initiate cavitation.
