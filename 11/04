In PSC, an approximate solution, generally expressed\nas a sum over a set of orthogonal basis functions (e.g., Chebyshev\npolynomials), is substituted into the exact system of equations and the\nresidual minimized. For systems with analytic solutions the approximate\nsolutions converge upon the exact solution exponentially as the number of basis\nfunctions is increased. Consequently, PSC has a high computational efficiency:\nfor solutions of even modest accuracy we find that PSC is substantially more\nefficient, as measured by either execution time or memory required, than finite\ndifferencing; furthermore, these savings increase rapidly with increasing\naccuracy. The solution provided by PSC is an analytic function given\neverywhere; consequently, no interpolation operators need to be defined to\ndetermine the function values at intermediate points and no special\narrangements need to be made to evaluate the solution or its derivatives on the\nboundaries. Since the practice of numerical relativity by finite differencing\nhas been, and continues to be, hampered by both high computational resource\ndemands and the difficulty of formulating acceptable finite difference\nalternatives to the analytic boundary conditions, PSC should be further pursued\nas an alternative way of formulating the computational problem of finding\nnumerical solutions to the field equations of general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 1999 22:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

SUSY with broken R-parity provides an attractive way to\nincorporate it, opening the possibility of testing nu-anomalies at high- energy\ncolliders such as the LHC or at the upcoming long-baseline or nu- factory\nexperiments.

In the limit of\ninfinite-number of zero-mass beads, it becomes a field-theoretic string.\nAnother interesting limit is to keep only two pearls by eliminating all others,\nresulting in a harmonic oscillator. The basic strength of the oscillator model\nis its mathematical simplicity. This encourages us to construct two-pearl\nstrings for a covariant picture of relativistic extended particles. We achieve\nthis goal by transforming the oscillator model of Feynman {\\it et al.} into a\nrepresentation of the Poincar\\'e group. We then construct representations of\nthe O(3)-like little group for those oscillator states, which dictates their\ninternal space-time symmetry of massive particles.
