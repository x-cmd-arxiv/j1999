We use the terms ``CLV spectra'' and ``visibility spectra'' for\nthese plots. We discuss a model-predicted extreme limb-darkening effect (also\ncalled the narrow-bright-core effect) in very strong TiO bands which can lead\nto a misinterpretation of the size of a star in these bands. We find no\nevidence as yet that this effect occurs in real stars.

This scheme can compress the phase-space density and can\nultimately yield an optically-driven atom laser. An important issue is the\nsuppression of photon scattering due to ``cross-talk'' between the mirror\npotential and the trapping potential. We propose that for alkali atoms the\nphoton scattering rate can be suppressed by several orders of magnitude if the\natoms are decoupled from the evanescent-wave light. We discuss how such dark\nstates can be achieved by making use of circularly-polarized evanescent waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 1999 11:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1999 14:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
