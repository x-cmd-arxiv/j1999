At one side of the shocked\nlayer, its surface condition is determined via the ram pressure, while at the\nother side the thermal pressure supports its structure. When the ram pressure\ndominates the thermal pressure, we expect deceleration of the shocked layer.\nEspecially, in this paper, we examine how the stratification of the\ndecelerating layer has an effect on its dynamical stability. Performing the\nlinear perturbation analysis, a {\\it more general} dispersion relation than the\nprevious one obtained by one of the authors is derived.

On\nthe contrary, in the late stages, it is possible for the shocked layer to be\nunstable for the DSI (in smaller scale) and the gravitational instability (in\nlarger scale).

The analysis method based on an expansion of decay\namplitude into a series of hyperspherical harmonics is reviewed. The basis of\nhyperspherical harmonics functions is a generalisation of the spherical\nfunction basis in three-body systems. The method is tested on analysis of the\ndirect 2p-decay of Be^6 where the three-body components in the nuclear\nstructure of Be^6 have been studied.

Different physical mechanisms dominate at one\nor the other end of this range. For example, in the energy loss problem, soft\ncollisions that are screened by collective effects are important at large\ndistances, while at short distances hard collisions are important where the\nexact details of the single-particle interactions must be taken into account.\nWe introduce a novel application of dimensional continuation. The soft\nprocesses dominate at all scales when the spatial dimension \\nu is less than 3,\nand we use them to compute the result to leading order for \\nu < 3. On the\nother hand, the hard processes dominate at all scales for \\nu > 3, and we use\nthem to compute the result to leading order for these spatial dimensions. We\nthen explain why the sum of the analytic continuation of these disparate\nmechanisms yields the correct leading-order result for the physical limit at\n\\nu = 3 dimensions. After applying this new method to the energy loss problem\nin some detail, we then show how it also provides a very short and easy way to\ncompute the Lamb shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 1999 01:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2000 23:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

However, such simple limits\nare not the only limits. I here suggest a new limit which comes from the forms\nand the strengths of the elementary interactions. Namely, there are only four\ntypes of elementary interactions in nature; their forms are determined by the\ngauge invariance (and symmetry breaking), and their coupling constants (in the\nlow-energy regime) have definite values.
