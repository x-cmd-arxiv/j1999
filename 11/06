We discuss (i) the appearence of different time-scales,\n(ii) the modification of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and its relation\nto effective temperatures and partial equilibrations and (iii) the validity of\nOnsager reciprocity relations. We distinguish these properties by their\nreaction to infinitesimal perturbations. We recall that one can easily change\nthe time dependence of observables by applying an infinitesimal force while\ntime-reparametrization invariant features remain unchanged under the same\nperturbations. With the aim of better understanding these properties, we\nconsider the effect of several baths with different temperatures and\ntime-scales on the dynamics. This is done in two ways: numerically, by using a\nespecially developed Monte Carlo algorithm that mimics the coupling to multiple\nbaths; analytically, by computing the time-dependent probability density of\nsimple systems in contact with multiple baths. We finally argue that these\nfeatures are related to supersymmetry, the reparametrization invariance of the\nslow dynamics and its spontaneous breaking. This scenario is consistent within\nany perturbative scheme.
