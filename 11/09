We point out a special sensitivity of\nthe tensor analyzing power to the isoscalar longitudinal form factor of the\nRoper resonance excitation. The main argument is that the $S_{11}(1535)$,\n$D_{13}(1520)$ and $S_{11}(1650)$ resonances have only isovector longitudinal\nform factors. It is the longitudinal form factor of the Roper excitation, which\nplays an important role in the $t-$dependence of the tensor analyzing power.
