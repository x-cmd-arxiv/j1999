The Kolmogorov power\nlaw is a satisfactory model for the electron density spectrum at scales between\n20 megameters and 1 gigameter. We compare the observations with model\ncalculations from weak scintillation theory and the known transverse velocities\nof the pulsar and the Earth. The simplest model is that the scattering is\nuniformly distributed along the 310 pc line of sight (l=140 deg, b=32 deg) and\nis stationary in the LSR.

In YLW15, the X-ray emission is in the form of\nquasi-periodic energetic flares, which we explain in terms of strong magnetic\nshearing and reconnection between the central star and the accretion disk. In\nWL6, X-ray flaring is rotationally modulated, and appears to be more like the\nsolar-type magnetic activity ubiquitous on T Tauri stars. We find that YLW15 is\na fast rotator (near break-up), while WL6 rotates with a significantly longer\nperiod. We derive a mass M_\\star ~ 2 M_\\odot and \\simlt 0.4 M_\\odot for the\ncentral stars of YLW15 and WL6 respectively. On the long term, the interactions\nbetween the star and the disk results in magnetic braking and angular momentum\nloss of the star. On time scales t_{br} ~ a few 10^5 yrs, i.e., of the same\norder as the estimated duration of the Class~I protostar stage.

The rapid rotation and\nstrong star-disk magnetic interactions of YLW15 also naturally explain the\nobservation of X-ray ``superflares''. In the case of YLW15, and perhaps also of\nother protostars, a hot coronal wind (T~10^6 K) may be responsible for the VLA\nthermal radio emission.

This enigmatic class\nof objects presents narrow-emission line optical spectra classifying these\ngalaxies as star-forming on the basis of the diagnostic emission line ratios;\nyet, the presence of weak Halpha broad wings also suggests the presence of a\nweak or obscured AGN. The ASCA spectrum can be represented with a power-law\nwith a photon index of 1.76+-0.08. Strong variability is detected (by about a\nfactor of three) between the ROSAT and ASCA 1-2 keV flux.

Thus the X-ray spectrum is consistent with an\nunobscured Seyfert-1 interpretation.

Finally, the possibility that IRAS00317-2142 may\nharbour a heavily obscured AGN where the X-ray emission is mainly due to\nscattered light, appears less plausible due to the high value of the fx/f[OIII]\nratio which is more indicative of unobscured Seyfert-1 type AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 1999 11:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

An\norbital-free version of the Car-Parrinello technique is used which scales\nlinearly with system size allowing investigation of the thermal behaviour of\nlarge clusters. The ground state isomer of Na_142 (an uncomplete three-shell\nicosahedron) melts in two steps: the first one (at approx. 240 K) is\ncharacterized by the high mobility of the atoms located on the cluster surface;\nthe second, homogeneous melting (at approx. 270 K), involves diffusive motion\nof all the atoms across the cluster. For the case of Na_92, the icosahedral\nstructure has a larger number of surface vacancies, and melts in two well\nseparated steps, surface melting at approx. 130 K and homogeneous melting at\napprox. 240 K. Na_55, a complete two-shell icosahedron, melts in a single stage\nat approx. 190 K. Our results on homogeneous melting for Na_142 and Na_92 are\nin excellent agreement with recent experimental determinations of melting\ntemperatures and latent heats. However, the experimentally observed enhancement\nof the melting temperature around N=55 is not reproduced by the calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 1999 20:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 May 2000 07:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper, the idea of replacing observation, as the cause of\ndecoherence, with rules derived from the dynamics of the system is addressed.\nSuch rules determine the timing of decoherence and the states in the mixture\nafterward. For instance, energy conservation during decohenence, for each\npossible transition, leads to a timing rule. Exponetial decay and ergodic\nbehavior follow directly from the dynamic rules as do Boltzman's postulate of\nequally probable micro-states and the Pauli rate equations. Ergodic behavior in\nmesoscopic systems is predicted and those preditions are strikingly similar to\nbehavior observed in at least two laboratories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 1999 22:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 1999 22:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2000 23:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
