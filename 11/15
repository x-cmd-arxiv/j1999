We focus on\ntwo spectral regions; the first one (the 10-micron region), probes atmospheric\nlevels between 1 and 0.2 bar, while the second one (the 5-micron window),\nsounds the atmosphere between 8 and 2 bars. The two spectral windows cannot be\nfitted with the same ammonia vertical distribution. From the 10-micron region\nwe infer an ammonia distribution of about half the saturation profile above the\n1-bar level, where the N/H ratio is roughly solar. A totally different picture\nis derived from the 5-micron window, where we determine an upper limit of\n3.7E-5 at 1 bar and find an increasing NH3 abundance at least down to 4 bar.\nThis profile is similar to the one measured by the Galileo probe (Folkner et\nal. 1998). The discrepancy between the two spectral regions most likely arises\nfrom the spatial heterogeneity of Jupiter, the 5-micron window sounding dry\nareas unveiled by a locally thin cloud cover (the 5-micron hot spots), and the\n10-micron region probing the mean jovian atmosphere above 1 bar. The 15NH3\nmixing ratio is measured around 400 mbar from nu_2 band absorptions in the\n10-micron region.
