In this magnetar model, the magnetic\nenergy and gravitational energy of the neutron stars are suggested as the\nenergy sources of all the emission and winds. However, Harding, Contopoulos &\nKazanas (1999) have shown that the magnetic field should be only ~ 3 x 10^{13}\nG in order to match the characteristic spin-down timescale of SGR 1806-20 and\nits SNR age. Here we argue that if the magnetic field is indeed so weak, the\npreviously suggested energy sources seem problematic. We further propose a\nplausible model in which SGR pulsars are young strange stars with\nsuperconducting cores and with a poloidal magnetic field of ~ 3 x 10^{13} G. In\nthis model, the movement of the flux tubes not only leads to crustal cracking\nof the stars, giving rise to deconfinement of crustal matter to strange matter,\nbut also to movement of internal magnetic toruses with the flux tubes. The\nformer process will result in burst and quiescence emission and the latter\nprocess will produce steady relativistic winds which will power the surrounding\nsupernova remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1999 11:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The cosmological expansion decreases the temperature and\ntriggers the phase transition. We identify three different time scales: an\nearly regime dominated by linear instabilities and the exponential growth of\nlong-wavelength fluctuations,an intermediate scale when the field fluctuations\nprobe the broken symmetry states and an asymptotic scale wherein a scaling\nregime emerges for modes of wavelength comparable to or larger than the\nhorizon.The scaling regime is characterized by a dynamical physical correlation\nlength xi_{phys} = d_H(t) with d_H(t) the size of the causal horizon, thus\nthere is one correlated region per causal horizon. Inside these correlated\nregions the field fluctuations sample the broken symmetry states. The amplitude\nof the long-wavelength fluctuations becomes non-perturbatively large due to the\nearly times instabilities and a semiclassical but stochastic description\nemerges in the asymptotic regime. In the scaling regime, the power spectrum is\npeaked at zero momentum revealing the onset of a Bose-Einstein condensate.The\nscaling solution results in that the equation of state of the scalar fields is\nthe same as that of the background fluid.

A single whistler mode\nwave propagating parallel to the background magnetic field has resonance with\nthe electrons but the process is not stochastic.
