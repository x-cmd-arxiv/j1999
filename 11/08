Some AGN also show a\npronounced time delay between variations seen in their optical continuum and in\ntheir emission lines. In effect, the emission lines are light echoes of the\ncontinuum. This light travel-time delay provides a characteristic radius of the\nregion producing the emission lines. The cross correlation function (CCF) is\nthe standard tool used to measure the time lag between the continuum and line\nvariations. For the few well-sampled AGN, the lag ranges from 1-100 days,\ndepending upon which line is used and the luminosity of the AGN. In the best\nsampled AGN, NGC 5548, the H_beta lag shows year-to-year changes, ranging from\nabout 8.7 days to about 22.9 days over a span of 8 years. In this paper it is\ndemonstrated that, in the context of AGN variability studies, the lag estimate\nusing the CCF is biased too low and subject to a large variance. Thus the\nyear-to-year changes of the measured lag in NGC 5548 do not necessarily imply\nchanges in the AGN structure. The bias and large variance are consequences of\nfinite duration sampling and the dominance of long timescale trends in the\nlight curves, not due to noise or irregular sampling. Lag estimates can be\nsubstantially improved by removing low frequency power from the light curves\nprior to computing the CCF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 1999 21:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
