Previous observations have revealed 3 \"classical\"\nT Tauri stars and 1 \"weak-line\" T Tauri star along the line of sight to the\ncloud. Because of the proximity of the cloud to the sun, all of the previously\nknown TTS along this line of sight were detected in the 25 ks ROSAT PSPC\npointed observation of the cloud. We conducted follow-up optical spectroscopy\nat the 2.2-meter telescope at Calar Alto to look for signatures of youth in\nadditional X-ray selected T Tauri star candidates. These observations allowed\nus to confirm the existence of 4 additional TTS associated with the cloud and\nat least 2 young main sequence stars that are not associated with the cloud and\nplace an upper limit on the age of the TTS in MBM12 ~ 10 Myr.\n  The distance to MBM12 has been revised from the previous estimate of 65+-5 pc\nto 65+-35 pc based on results of the Hipparcos satellite. At this distance\nMBM12 is the nearest known molecular cloud to the sun with recent star\nformation. We estimate a star-formation efficiency for the cloud of 2-24%.\n  We have also identified a reddened G9 star behind the cloud with Av ~ 8.4-8.9\nmag.

We show that for a choice of Kahler\nmetric the Borcea-Voisin threefold has a fibration structure with generic fiber\nbeing a Special Lagrangian torus. Moreover we construct a mirror to this\nfibration. Also for any closed G_2 form on a 7-manifold we study coassociative\nsubmanifolds and we show that one example of a G_2 manifold constructed by\nJoyce in [10] is a fibration with generic fiber being a coassociative 4-torus.\nSimilarly we construct a mirror to this fibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 1999 20:09:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2000 00:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The construction was successfully used in the\ntheory of integrable systems, particularly, for the KP and KdV equations. There\nwere also found some applications to the moduli of algebraic curves. But there\nremained a hard restriction by the case of curves, so by dimension 1. Recently,\nit was pointed out by the author that there are some connections between the\ntheory of the KP-equations and the theory of n-dimensional local fields. From\nthis point of view it becomes clear that the Krichever construction should have\na generalization to the case of higher dimensions.
