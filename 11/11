These inhomogeneities lead to\ndifferent element abundance patterns in very metal-poor stars, which can be\nseen as scatter in the abundances of halo stars with metallicities [Fe/H] <\n2.0. The early chemical evolution of the halo proceeds in different enrichment\nphases: At [Fe/H] < -3.0, the halo ISM is unmixed and dominated by local\ninhomogeneities caused by single core-collapse supernova (SN) events. For\nmetallicities [Fe/H] >-2.0 the halo ISM is well mixed, showing an element\nabundance pattern integrated over the initial mass function.

However, we are now able to\npinpoint actual, remotely-situated Carina stars individually. Because we can\nexclude foreground dwarf stars, our approach allows greater sensitivity and the\nability to map the detailed two-dimensional distribution of extended Carina\npopulations to much larger radii, with smaller aperture telescopes, than other\ntechniques. Moreover, we identify candidate lists of widely displaced\nCarina-associated stars bright enough for spectroscopic studies of large-scale\ndynamical and metallicity properties of the system, and for astrometric study\nby SIM. We obtained spectroscopy for three such ``extratidal'' stars and from\ntheir radial velocities conclude that all three are associated with Carina.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 1999 23:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

If C has, at worst,\npoints of multiplicity 2, then A_L^* is an isomorphism, and forming it commutes\nwith specializing C.\n  Much of our work is valid, more generally, for a family of curves with, at\nworst, points of embedding dimension 2. In this case, we use the determinant of\ncohomology to construct a right inverse to A_L^*. Then we prove a\nscheme-theoretic version of the theorem of the cube, generalizing Mumford's,\nand use it to prove that A_L^* is independent of the choice of L.

Free particle states are\nconstructed using Dirac's delta function orthogonality conditions. The states\n(doublets) depend on two quantum numbers: energy and parity. With the aid of\nprojection operators the particles are confined to a constrained region, in a\nway similar to the action of an infinite well potential. From the resulting\novercomplete basis only the mutually orthogonal states are selected. Four\nsolutions are found, corresponding to different non-commuting Hamiltonians.\nTheir energy eigenstates are labeled with the main quantum number n and parity\n\"+\" or \"-\". The energy eigenvalues are functions of n only. The four cases\ncorrespond to different boundary conditions: (I) the wave function vanishes on\nthe boundary, (II) the derivative of the wavefunction vanishes on the\nboundary,(III) periodic (symmetric) boundary conditions, (IV) periodic\n(antisymmetric)boundary conditions . Among the four cases, only solution (III)\nforms a complete basis in the sense that any function in the constrained\nregion, can be expanded with it. By extending the boundaries of the constrained\nregion to infinity, only solution (III) converges uniformly to the free\nparticle states. Orthogonality seems to be a more basic requirement than\nboundary conditions. By using projection operators, confinement of the particle\nto a definite region can be achieved in a conceptually simple and unambiguous\nway, and physical operators can be written so that they act only in the\nconfined region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 1999 22:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
