The resulting color-magnitude diagrams reveal the\nmorphology of the horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf galaxy. We find that\nlike Andromeda I, and like most of the Galactic dSph companions, the HB\nmorphology of And II is predominantly red. Unlike And I, however, there is no\nevidence for a radial gradient in HB morphology in the And II data. At least\n50% of the total stellar population in And II is younger than the age of the\nglobular clusters. On the other hand, the existence of blue HB and RR Lyrae\nvariable stars in And II argues for the existence of an additional old (age >\n10 Gyr) population. Thus And II has had an extended epoch of star formation\nlike many of the Galactic dSphs. Our derived distance confirms the association\nof And II with M31, rather than with M33 to which And II lies closer on the\nsky. The true distance of And II from the center of M31 is between 160 and 230\nkpc. With the current samples of dSph companions, the size of the Galaxy's and\nM31's dSph satellite systems are comparable, with outer radii of order 250 kpc.\nThe And II red giant branch colors yield a mean abundance of <[Fe/H]> = -1.49\n+/- 0.11 and a surprisingly large internal abundance spread, which can be\ncharacterized by sigma(int)([Fe/H]) ~ 0.36 dex, considerably larger than that\nderived for And I (0.21) from an identical analysis of similar data. Thus\ndespite having very similar luminosities and mean metal abundances, these two\nM31 dSph companions have clearly had different chemical evolution histories.

Prompted by new observations of rotation rates of horizontal\nbranch stars, we calculate simple models for the angular momentum evolution of\na globular cluster giant star from the base of the giant branch to the star's\nappearance on the horizontal branch. We include mass loss, and infer the\naccompanied loss of angular momentum for each of four assumptions about the\ninternal angular momentum profile. These models are compared to observations of\nhorizontal branch rotation rates in M13. We find that rapid rotation on the\nhorizontal branch can be reconciled with slow solid body main sequence rotation\nif giant branch stars have differential rotation in their convective envelopes\nand a rapidly rotating core, which is then followed by a redistribution of\nangular momentum on the horizontal branch. We discuss the physical reasons why\nthese very different properties relative to the solar case may exist in giants.\nRapid rotation in the core of the main sequence precursors of the rapidly\nrotating horizontal branch star, or an angular momentum source on the giant\nbranch is required for all cases if the rotational velocity of turnoff stars is\nless than 4 km s$^{-1}$.

In this picture, any quantum search operation is a rotation in a 3\ndimensional space. Exact formulas for the rotation angle and rotational axis\nare given. The probability of finding the marked state is just $(z+1)/2$, where\nz is the z-component of the state vector. Exact formulas for this probability\nis easily obtained. The phase matching requirement and the failure of algorithm\nwhen phase mismatches are clearly explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 1999 13:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These bifurcating solutions include, as particular cases, the\nusual stationary and Hopf bifurcations. The main idea is to transform the given\ndynamical system into normal form (in the sense of Poincar\\'e-Dulac), and to\nimpose that the normalizing transformation is convergent, using the convergence\nconditions in the form given by A.

Some specially interesting\nsituations, including the cases of multiple-periodic solutions, and of\ndegenerate eigenvalues in the presence of symmetry, are also discussed with\nsome detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 1999 11:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
