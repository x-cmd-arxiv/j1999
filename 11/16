Irwin et al. 1989;\nCorrigan et al. 1991; Ostensen et al. 1996) has been interpreted in two\ndifferent ways; as microlensing by stellar mass objects of a continuum source\nhaving dimensions significantly smaller than the microlens Einstein radius (ER)\n(eg. Wambsganss, Paczynski & Schneider 1990; Rauch & Blandford 1991), and as\nmicrolensing by very low mass objects of a source as large as 5 ER (Refsdal &\nStabell 1993; Haugan 1996). In this paper we present evidence in favour of a\nsmall source. Limits on the source size (in units of ER) are obtained from the\ncombination of limits on the number of microlens Einstein radii crossed by the\nsource during the monitoring period with two separate light-curve features.\nFirstly, recently published monitoring data (Wozniak et al. 2000; OGLE web\npage) show large variations (~0.8-1.5 magnitudes) between image brightnesses\nover a period of 700 days or ~15% of the monitoring period. Secondly, the 1988\npeak in the image A light-curve had a duration that is a small fraction (<0.02)\nof the monitoring period. Such rapid microlensing rises and short microlensing\npeaks only occur for small sources. We find that the observed large-rapid\nvariation limits the source size to be <0.2 ER (95% confidence). The width of\nthe light-curve peak provides a stronger constraint of <0.02 ER (99%\nconfidence). The Einstein radius (projected into the source plane) of the\naverage microlens mass (m) in Q2237+0305 is ER ~ 10^{17}\\sqrt{m} cm. The\ninterpretation that stars are responsible for microlensing in Q2237+0305\ntherefore results in limits on the continuum source size that are consistent\nwith current accretion disc theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 1999 17:15:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2000 21:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We apply the\nmodel predictions of the liquid water characteristics to the evolution of amino\nacids. IN some regions of the parent body, very little change occurs in the\namino acids, but for the majority of the asteroid, complete racemization or\neven destruction occurs. We attempt to match our thermal model results with CM\nmeteorite observations, but thus far, our model does not produce scenarios that\nare fully consistent with these observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 1999 20:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
