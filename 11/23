This can be explained by the short time scale for the\ndestruction of dust grains within hot gas compared to the formation timescale\nof such dust lanes in early-type galaxies.\n  Dust within ellipticals in ``loose'' environments (in the field or in loose\ngroups) is typically characterized by small values of R_V = A_V/E(B-V) (i.e.,\nsmall characteristic grain sizes), and distributed in dust lanes with a smooth,\nrelaxed morphology. On the other hand, dust in ellipticals that are in or near\nthe center of dense groups or clusters is typically much more irregularly\ndistributed, and characterized by R_V values that are close to the Galactic\none.\n  I predict that ellipticals containing ``relaxed'' dust lanes with typical\ndust masses of 10E6 - 10E7 solar masses do not contain hot, X-ray-emitting gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 1999 16:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It\nappears that the intrinsic vertical colour gradients are either non-existent,\nor small and relatively constant as a function of position along the galaxies'\nmajor axes. Our results are consistent with the absence of any vertical colour\ngradient in the discs of the early-type sample galaxies. In most galaxies\nsmall-scale variations in the magnitude and even the direction of the vertical\ngradient are observed: at larger galactocentric distances they generally\ndisplay redder colours with increasing z height, whereas the opposite is often\nobserved in and near the galactic centres. For a significant fraction of our\nsample galaxies another mechanism in addition to the effects of stellar\npopulation gradients is required to explain the magnitude of the observed\ngradients. The non-zero colour gradients in a significant fraction of our\nsample galaxies are likely (at least) partially due to residual dust extinction\nat these z heights, as is also evidenced from the sometimes significant\ndifferences between the vertical colour gradients measured on either side of\nthe galactic planes. We suggest that initial vertical metallicity gradients, if\nany, have likely not been accentuated by accretion or merging events over the\nlifetimes of our sample galaxies.

This flow of\nmetrics stays inside the class of asymptotically flat Riemannian 3-manifolds\nwith nonnegative scalar curvature which contain minimal spheres. In particular,\nif we consider a Riemannian 3-manifold as a totally geodesic submanifold of a\nspace-time in the context of general relativity, then outermost minimal spheres\nwith total area $A$ correspond to apparent horizons of black holes contributing\na mass $\\sqrt{A/16\\pi}$, scalar curvature corresponds to local energy density\nat each point, and the rate at which the metric becomes flat at infinity\ncorresponds to total mass. The Riemannian Penrose conjecture then states that\nthe total mass of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar\ncurvature is greater than or equal to the mass contributed by the black holes.\n  The flow of metrics we define continuously evolves the original 3-metric to a\nSchwarzschild 3-metric, which represents a spherically symmetric black hole in\nvacuum. We define the flow such that the area of the minimal spheres (which\nflow outward) and hence the mass contributed by the black holes in each of the\nmetrics in the flow is constant, and then use the positive mass theorem to show\nthat the total mass of the metrics is nonincreasing. Then since the total mass\nequals the mass of the black holes in a Schwarzschild metric, the Riemannian\nPenrose conjecture follows.\n  This result improves upon the beautiful work of Huisken and Ilmanen, who used\ninverse mean curvature flows of surfaces to show that the total mass is at\nleast the mass contributed by the largest black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 1999 00:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Fock space representations $V_p$ of $q(n+1)$ are defined by\nmeans of these creation and annihilation operators. These new representations\nare introduced as quotient modules of some induced module of $q(n+1)$. The\nrepresentations $V_p$ are not graded, but they possess a number of properties\nthat are of importance for physical applications. For $p$ a positive integer,\nthese representations $V_p$ are finite-dimensional, with a unique highest\nweight (of multiplicity 1). The Hermitian form that is consistent with the\nnatural adjoint operation on $q(n+1)$ is shown to be positive definite on\n$V_p$. For $q(2)$ these representations are ``dispin''. For the general case of\n$q(n+1)$, many structural properties of $V_p$ are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 1999 09:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2000 09:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We show that\nthe Chevalley isomorphism theorem cannot be generalized to algebras if the\nZ_n-grading or other structures are added, e.g., a linear form. We work with\npairs consisting of a Clifford algebra and a linear form or a Z_n-grading which\nwe now call 'Clifford algebras of multi-vectors' or 'quantum Clifford\nalgebras'. It turns out, that in this sense, all multi-vector Clifford algebras\nof the same quadratic but different bilinear forms are non-isomorphic. The\nusefulness of such algebras in quantum field theory and superconductivity was\nshown elsewhere. Allowing for arbitrary bilinear forms however spoils their\ndiagonalizability which has a considerable effect on the tensor decomposition\nof the Clifford algebras governed by the periodicity theorems, including the\nAtiyah-Bott-Shapiro mod 8 periodicity. We consider real algebras Cl_{p,q} which\ncan be decomposed in the symmetric case into a tensor product Cl_{p-1,q-1}\n\\otimes Cl_{1,1}.
