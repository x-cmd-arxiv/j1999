In these\nmodels, the HXR emission is due to suprathermal electrons with energies of\nabout 10-200 keV. Under the assumption that the suprathermal electrons form\npart of a continuous spectrum of electrons including highly relativistic\nparticles, we have calculated the inverse Compton (IC) extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV), HXR, and radio synchrotron emission by the extensions of the same\npopulations. For accelerating electron models with power-law momentum spectra\n(N[p] propto p^{- mu}) with mu <~ 2.7, which are those expected from strong\nshock acceleration, the IC HXR emission exceeds that due to NTB. Thus, these\nmodels are only of interest if the electron population is cut-off at some upper\nenergy <~1 GeV. Similarly, flat spectrum accelerating electron models produce\nmore radio synchrotron emission than is observed from clusters if the ICM\nmagnetic field is B >~ 1 muG. The cooling electron model produces vastly too\nmuch EUV emission as compared to the observations of clusters. We have compared\nthese NTB models to the observed HXR tails in Coma and Abell 2199. The NTB\nmodels require a nonthermal electron population which contains about 3% of the\nnumber of electrons in the thermal ICM. If the suprathermal electron population\nis cut-off at some energy above 100 keV, then the models can easily fit the\nobserved HXR fluxes and spectral indices in both clusters. For accelerating\nelectron models without a cutoff, the electron spectrum must be rather steep >~\n2.9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1999 16:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This survey covers all known nearby galaxy groups within\nthe Local Volume (i.e. within 10 Mpc) and their environment, that is about 25%\nof the total sky. A total of 257 galaxies have been observed with a detection\nrate of 60%. We searched a frequency band corresponding to heliocentric radial\nvelocities from -470 km/s to about +4000 km/s. Non-detections are either due to\nlimited coverage in radial velocity, confusion with Local HI (mainly in the\nvelocity range -140 km/s to +20 km/s, or lack of sensitivity for very weak\nemission. 25% of the detected galaxies are located within the Local Volume.\nThose galaxies are dwarf galaxies judged by their optical linear diameter (1.4\n+/- 0.2 kpc on the average), their mean total HI mass (4.6 E7 solar masses),\nand their observed linewidths (39 km/s).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 1999 09:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The quadratic part is\ndiagonalized exactly by transforming to a quasiparticle basis, while the\nnon-quadratic terms are dealt with using first and second order perturbation\ntheory. The conventional treatment of these terms, based on factorization\napproximations, is shown to be inconsistent.\n  Infra-red divergences can appear in individual terms of the perturbation\nexpansion, but we show analytically that the total contribution beyond\nquadratic order is finite. The resulting excitation spectrum is gapless and the\nenergy shifts are small for a dilute gas away from the critical region,\njustifying the use of perturbation theory. Ultra-violet divergences can appear\nif a contact potential is used to describe particle interactions.

The folding produces many connected parallel\nbranes or folds with identical microphysics - a Manyfold. Nearby matter on\nother folds can be detected gravitationally as dark matter since the light it\nemits takes a long time to reach us traveling around the fold. Hence dark\nmatter is microphysically identical to ordinary matter; it can dissipate and\nclump possibly forming dark replicas of ordinary stars which are good MACHO\ncandidates. Its dissipation may lead to far more frequent occurrence of\ngravitational collapse and consequently to a significant enhancement in\ngravitational wave signals detectable by LIGO and LISA. Sterile neutrinos find\na natural home on the other folds. Since the folded brane is not a BPS state,\nit gives a new geometric means for supersymmetry breaking in our world. It may\nalso offer novel approach for the resolution of the cosmological horizon\nproblem, although it still requires additional dynamics to solve the flatness\nproblem. Although there are constraints from BBN, structure formation, the\nenormity of galactic halos and the absence of stars and globular clusters with\na discernible dark matter component, we show that the model is consistent with\ncurrent observational limits. It presents us with a new dark matter particle\nand a new framework for the evolution of structure in our universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1999 22:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The theory of non-linear dynamics provides signal analysis\ntechniques which may give new information on the behaviour of such networks.\nMethods: We calculated correlation dimension maps for 19-channel EEG data from\n3 patients with a total of 7 absence seizures. The signals were analysed\nbefore, during and after the seizures. Phase randomised surrogate data was used\nto test chaos. Results: In the seizures of two patients we could distinguish\ntwo dynamical regions on the cerebral cortex, one that seemed to exhibit chaos\nwhereas the other seemed to exhibit noise. The pattern shown is essentially the\nsame for seizures triggered by hyperventilation, but differ for seizures\ntriggered by light flashes. The chaotic dynamics that one seems to observe is\ndetermined by a small number of variables and has low complexity. On the other\nhand, in the seizures of another patient no chaotic region was found. Before\nand during the seizures no chaos was found either, in all cases. Conclusions:\nThe application of non-linear signal analysis revealed the existence of\ndifferences in the spatial dynamics associated to absence seizures. This may\ncontribute to the understanding of those seizures and be of assistance in\nclinical diagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1999 20:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The possibility of the\nexistence of a phenomenon of a special mode of interaction, labeled as \"chiral\ninteraction\" (CI), for which structural chirality is a necessary condition, is\nthe main reason for such an advantage. In order to demonstrate such a\npossibility, macroscopic chiral devices are introduced and presented as\nanalogies for such an interaction. For this purpose it is important to make a\nclear distinction between geometric and physical chiralities, where the latter\nare capable to perform chiral interactions with various media. Apart from\nchirality, a few other structural elements are required. In particular, the\npresence of an interface that separates between the chiral device and the\nmedium with which it is interacting. The physical chirality is build into this\nvery interface where chiral interaction is taking place. On a molecular level,\nsoluble proteins in particular, the active medium is the presence of random\nionic motion in the aqueous solvent. As a result of chiral interaction a\ncertain perturbation, or current, is generated and flowing along the coils of $\n\\alpha$-helix structure in one preferred direction out of two possible ones. A\nmodel for such a chiral interaction is presented and a few significant\nconsequences are pointed out. In particular, it is important to emphasize the\ntime-irreversible feature of chiral interaction, which leads to its non-ergodic\nnature that is to be considered a necessary condition for evolutionary\nprocesses in biomolecules. There exists an experimental result by Careri et al.\nwho found a clear linkage between the free protonic motion in the hydration\nlayer of protein s and their enzymatic activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 1999 09:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We provide strong\nsupport for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely that\nthe minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted.\nExplicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on\nqubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with\nminimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using\nproduct states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image\nof the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the\nminimal entropy conjecture holds for non-unital as well as for unital maps. We\nalso show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most\nproduct maps on $n$-qubit states, including all those for which at least one\nmap is unital.\n  For the class of {\\it unital} channels on ${\\bf C}^2$, we show that\nadditivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo capacity of the channel\nis {\\it additive} over two inputs, achievable with orthogonal states, and equal\nto the Shannon capacity.
