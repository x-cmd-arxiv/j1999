The interaction within and between these channels is\nderived from an effective Lagrangian based on a chirally symmetric Lagrangian,\nwhich is supplemented by well known terms for the coupling of the Delta isobar,\nthe omega meson and the 'sigma', which is the name given here to the strong\ncorrelation of two pions in the scalar-isoscalar channel.

Three evident regimes are found in extension versus torsion\nand/or force versus extension plots: a low-force regime in which over- and\nunderwound molecules behave similarly under stretching; an intermediate-force\nregime in which chirality appears for negatively and positively supercoiled DNA\nand extension of underwound molecule is insensitive to the supercoiling degree\nof the polymer; and a large-force regime in which plectonemic DNA is fully\nconverted to extended DNA and supercoiled DNA behaves quite like a torsionless\nmolecule. The striking coincidence between theoretic calculations and recent\nexperimental measurement of torsionally stretched DNA [Strick et al., Science\n{\\bf 271}, 1835 (1996), Biophys. J. {\\bf 74}, 2016 (1998)] strongly suggests\nthat the interplay between base-stacking interaction and permanent\nhydrogen-bond constraint takes an important role in understanding the novel\nproperties of elasticity of supercoiled DNA polymer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 1999 10:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
