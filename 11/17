Comparing the observational properties with the\npredictions of stellar population synthesis model, we have analyzed the nuclear\nstellar population and emission line spectra in a sample of 10 BCGs. The\nresults indicate that the continuum flux fractions at 5870{\\AA} due to old\nstellar components and young stellar components are both important. The\ncontribution from intermediate age components is different in different\ngalaxies. Our results suggest that BCGs are old galaxies, in which star\nformation occurs in short intense burst separated by long quiescent phases. We\nhave also derived the internal reddening for the stellar population by\npopulation synthesis method, and the internal reddening for the emitting gas\nclouds by the Balmer line ratio. The former is significantly smaller than the\nlatter for BCGs. A model of clumpy foreground dust, with different covering\nfactors for the gas and stars, can explain the difference. Combining the\ninternal reddening value and the stellar population, we have decreased the\neffecting from the internal reddening and underlying stellar absorption, and\naccurately measured most emission lines for each BCGs. Using these emission\nlines, we have attempted to identify the ionizing mechanism of BCGs. The\nionizing mechanism for these emission line regions of BCGs is typical of\nphotoionization by stars, characteristics of a low extinction HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1999 06:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is the deepest ever computed in the near-infrared,\nfor any type of environment, extending over 7 magnitudes, down to ~M_H*+6. The\nLF was computed on a near-infrared selected sample of galaxies which\nphotometry, complete down to the typical dwarf luminosity, is presented in a\ncompanion paper. The Coma LF can be described by a Schechter function with\nintermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at M_H~-22 mag. The shape of the\nComa LF in H band is quite similar to the one found in the B band and, with\nless confidence, to the R band LF as well. The similarity of the LF in the\noptical and H bands implies that in the central region of Coma there is no new\npopulation of galaxies which is too faint to be observed in the optical band\n(because dust enshrouded, for instance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs. The\nexponential cut of the LF at the bright end is in good agreement with the one\nderived from shallower near-infrared samples of galaxies, both in clusters and\nin the field. This fact is suggestive of a similarity of the tip of the mass\nfunction of galaxies, irrespective of the environment where they are found. The\ndip at M_H~-22 mag is instead unique among all the so far measured\nnear-infrared LF, although several published observations are not deep enough\nor spanning a suitable wide field to distinctly detect this feature. The faint\nend of the LF, reaching M_H~-19 mag (roughly M_B~-15), is steep, but less than\npreviously suggested from shallower near-infrared observations of an adjacent\nregion in the Coma cluster. The differences between our measured LF and that\nmeasured previously in other regions suggests a dependency on environment of\nthe faint end of the mass function (below M*+2.5).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1999 07:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We consider an impulsively\nexcited acoustic disturbance, emanating from a point source, and propagating\noutward as a spherical acoustic wave accompanied by an internal gravity wave.\nThe waves amplify exponentially in the upward direction. A significant wave\namplitude is therefore found only in a relatively narrow cone about the\nvertical. The amplitude of the wave decreases with time. Because of the lateral\nspread, the wave amplitude decays faster in 2D and 3D simulations than in 1D.\nThe initial pulse, which travels at the sound speed, carries most of the energy\ninjected into the medium. Subsequent wave crests leave the source region at\never-increasing phase speed, but slow to the sound speed as they approach the\nhead of the wave. Important conclusions from the 3D solution that were not\nanticipated from the plane-wave solution are:\n  1.

As the\ncompactness is decreased, the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. It\nis also found that a differentially rotating massive neutron star is formed\ninstead of a black hole for less compact binary cases, in which the rest mass\nof each star is less than 70-80% of the maximum allowed mass of a spherical\nstar. In the case of black hole formation, we roughly evaluate the mass of the\ndisk around the black hole. For the merger of corotational binaries, a disk of\nmass $\\sim 0.05-0.1M_*$ may be formed, where M_* is the total rest mass of the\nsystem. On the other hand, for the merger of irrotational binaries, the disk\nmass appears to be very small : < 0.01M_*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 1999 19:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These\nfractional charges arise from the interpretation of the standard topological\ncharge integral as a sum of (integral) intersection numbers weighted by certain\n(fractional) traces. We show that without nexuses the sum of intersection\nnumbers gives vanishing topological charge (since vortex surfaces are closed\nand compact). With nexuses living as world lines on vortices, the contributions\nto the total intersection number are weighted by different trace factors, and\nyield a picture of the total topological charge as a linking of a closed nexus\nworld line with a vortex surface; this linking gives rise to a non-vanishing\nbut integral topological charge. This reflects the standard 2\\pi periodicity of\nthe theta angle. We argue that the Witten-Veneziano relation, naively violating\n2\\pi periodicity, scales properly with N at large N without requiring 2\\pi N\nperiodicity. This reflects the underlying composition of localized fractional\ntopological charge, which are in general widely separated. Some simple models\nare given of this behavior. Nexuses lead to non-standard vortex surfaces for\nall SU(N) and to surfaces which are not manifolds for N>2. We generalize\npreviously-introduced nexuses to all SU(N) in terms of a set of fundamental\nnexuses, which can be distorted into a configuration resembling the 't\nHooft-Polyakov monopole with no strings. The existence of localized but\nwidely-separated fractional topological charges, adding to integers only on\nlong distance scales, has implications for chiral symmetry breakdown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 1999 21:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
