The present model can describe the dynamics of any market where the\npricing is based on supply and demand.

The duality of the present model consists\nof the superposition of the two components - the long and the short term\nbehaviour of the market. The long term behaviour is characterised by a stable\ndevelopment which is following a trend for time periods of years or even\ndecades. This long term growth (or decline) is based on the development of\nfundamental market figures. The short term behaviour is described as a\ndynamical evaluation (trading) of the market by the participants. The trading\nprocess is described as an exchange between supply and demand. In the framework\nof this model there the trading is modelled by a system of nonlinear\ndifferential equations. The model also allows to explain the chaotic behaviour\nof the market as well as periods of growth or crashes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 1999 19:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the polarized Raman spectra at room temperature we\nobserve resonant enhancement of the 969 $cm^{-1}$ phonon mode when the laser\nenergy approaches 2.7 eV, presumably related to the (p-d) electron hopping\nband, $O_3$($p_y$)-V($d_{xy}$), at 3.2 eV. The 969 $cm^{-1}$ mode originates\nfrom the stretching vibrations along the c-axis involving the V-$O_1$ bonds.\nSince an ellipsometric determination of the dielectric function $\\epsilon_{cc}$\nyields no structure in the 1.7 to 5.5 eV photon energy range, we conclude that\nplane bonds couple strongly with the apical oxygens leading to a large Raman\nefficiency. In the low-temperature Raman spectra, almost all modes that become\nactive below the phase transition temperature T$_c$=34 K show resonant\nbehavior. The most interesting ones, those at 66 and 106 $cm^{-1}$, possibly of\nmagnetic origin, exhibit a resonant intensity enhancement, approximately by an\norder of magnitude, for laser photon energies around 1.85 eV with respect to\n2.43 eV. This resonance effect may be associated with a weak absorption band\naround 2 eV. Finally, a destructive interference between the resonant and the\nnonresonant contribution to the Raman scattering amplitude (i.e. an\nantiresonance) is found in the spectra for most of the (bb) low-temperature\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 1999 12:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
