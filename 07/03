In constant selective\nenvironments, such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different\nmechanisms. One the one hand, populations may become pinned at a local fitness\noptimum, being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a {\\em fitness\nbarrier} of low-fitness genotypes. On the other hand, the population may only\nbe metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while, at the same time,\ndiffusing over {\\em neutral networks} of selectively neutral genotypes.\nMetastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from\nhigher-fitness genotypes by an {\\em entropy barrier}: The population must\nexplore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare\nconnection to fitter phenotypes.\n  We derive analytical expressions for the barrier crossing times in both the\nfitness barrier and entropy barrier regime. In contrast with ``landscape''\nevolutionary models, we show that the waiting times to reach higher fitness\ndepend strongly on the width of a fitness barrier and much less on its height.\nThe analysis further shows that crossing entropy barriers is faster by orders\nof magnitude than fitness barrier crossing. Thus, when populations are trapped\nin a metastable phenotypic state, they are most likely to escape by crossing an\nentropy barrier, along a neutral path in genotype space. If no such escape\nroute along a neutral path exists, a population is most likely to cross a\nfitness barrier where the barrier is {\\em narrowest}, rather than where the\nbarrier is shallowest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1999 21:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
