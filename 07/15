The first pointing (A1) was centered west of the optical\nnucleus; the nucleus was on the eastern edge of the aperture. The second (A2)\nwas centered southwest of the optical nucleus with the nucleus well inside the\naperture. The third (B) was centered on the ionization cone, with the nucleus\non the southwestern edge of the aperture. While all three aperture locations\nhave spectra similar to the Astro-1 observations of Kriss et al., these new\nspatially resolved observations localize the source of the far-UV line and\ncontinuum emission. The ionization cone (B) has both brighter emission lines\nand continuum than the nucleus (A2). A1 is fainter than either A2 or B in both\nlines and continuum. The far-UV emission lines observed with HUT have a spatial\ndistribution that most similar to [O III] 5007, but appear to be more extended\nand offset to the northeast along the axis of the radio jet. This supports the\nprevious conclusion of Kriss et al. that the bright C III 977 and N III 991\narises in shock-heated gas. The UV continuum radiation has a more extended\nspatial distribution than the line-emitting gas. At wavelengths longward of\n1200 A the inferred continuum distribution is consistent with that seen in\narchival HST/WFPC2 F218W images, and it appears to contain a substantial\ncontribution from starlight. At wavelengths shorter than 1200 A, the UV\ncontinuum becomes more concentrated in the ionization cone, consistent with\nnuclear flux scattered by hot electrons and dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 1999 16:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

However, a straight reading of the\npublished measurements, conducted with no a priori idea of which model would\nbest describe our universe at least up to redshifts $z\\sim 1$, does not exclude\nthe possibility of ruling out the Cosmological Principle - and cosmological\nconstant - hypotheses. It is therefore shown here how the large scale\nhomogeneity of this part of the universe can be tested on our past light cone,\nusing the magnitude-redshift relation, provided sufficiently accurate data from\nsources at redshifts approaching $z=1$ would be available. An exemple of an\ninhomogeneous model with zero cosmological constant reproducing the current\nobservations is given.

We use\nrealistic boundary conditions derived consistently from the outside magnetic\nfield, and we also take into account the effect of the backpressure from the\nflow into the separatrix region. We find that within a few Alfven times the\nsystem reaches a steady state consistent with the Sweet--Parker model, even if\nthe initial state is Petschek-like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 1999 22:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This enables us to find the exact,\ncomplete and compact unperturbed solution of the Magyari's N+2 coupled and\nnonlinear algebraic conditions of the termination in the strong-coupling regime\nwith G \\to \\infty. Next, at G < \\infty, we adapt the Rayleigh-Schroedinger\nperturbation theory and define the bound states via an innovated, triple\nperturbation series.
