The\nwavelength coverage extends from 1000 A to 30,000 A, with particular emphasis\non the rest-frame UV. This makes these models especially applicable to\nstarburst galaxies and Lyman-break galaxy samples. The examination of the\nmodels concentrates on the study of UV/visual/near-IR reddening effects, the\nwavelength dependence of attenuation, and on the changes that arise from the\ntransition from homogeneous to clumpy dust distributions in different star/dust\ngeometries. Embedded dust, especially when clumpy, leads to saturation at\nfairly low reddening values with correspondingly gray attenuation functions.\nThis makes the assessment of the attenuation of the far-UV flux from starburst\ngalaxies difficult, if only UV/visual/near-IR data are available. Existing data\nfor UV-selected starburst galaxies indicate a range of UV attenuation factors\nof 0-150. Our models reproduce the \"Calzetti Attenuation Law\", provided one\nadopts SMC-type dust and a clumpy shell-type dust distribution surrounding the\nstarbursts. The average far-UV attenuation factor for the Calzetti sample is\nfound to be 7.4. The only relatively reliable measure for the UV attenuation\nfactor for single galaxies was found in the ratio of the integrated far-IR flux\nto the far-UV flux, measured near 1600 A, requiring the measurement of the\nentire spectral energy distribution of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 1999 18:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-05"}

We suggest an analogous new approach---weaker in\nstrength of evidence but more broadly applicable---to suggesting that\nconcrete~NP problems are not NP-complete. In particular we introduce the class\nEP, the subclass of NP consisting of those languages accepted by NP machines\nthat when they accept always have a number of accepting paths that is a power\nof two. Since if any NP-complete set is in EP then all NP sets are in EP, it\nfollows---with whatever degree of strength one believes that EP differs from\nNP---that membership in EP can be viewed as evidence that a problem is not\nNP-complete.\n  We show that the negation equivalence problem for OBDDs (ordered binary\ndecision diagrams) and the interchange equivalence problem for 2-dags are in\nEP. We also show that for boolean negation the equivalence problem is in\nEP^{NP}, thus tightening the existing NP^{NP} upper bound. We show that FewP,\nbounded ambiguity polynomial time, is contained in EP, a result that is not\nknown to follow from the previous SPP upper bound. For the three problems and\nclasses just mentioned with regard to EP, no proof of membership/containment in\nUP is known, and for the problem just mentioned with regard to EP^{NP}, no\nproof of membership in UP^{NP} is known. Thus, EP is indeed a tool that gives\nevidence against NP-completeness in natural cases where UP cannot currently be\napplied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 1999 10:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
