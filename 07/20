After a brief introduction into the Quantum\nAction Principle the conventional algebraic method which allows for the\nrestoration of the functional identities is discussed. The main point of our\napproach is the optimization of this procedure which results in an enormous\nreduction of the calculational effort. The counterterms which have to be\ncomputed are universal in the sense that they are independent of the\nregularization scheme. The method is explicitly illustrated for two processes\nof phenomenological interest: QCD corrections to the decay of the Higgs boson\ninto two photons and two-loop electroweak corrections to the process $B \\to X_s\n\\gamma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 1999 08:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2000 17:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Instead, the operator may\nbe merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a\nconsequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of\n\"unsharpness\" or \"fuzzyness\". For example, there are indications that this type\nof operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at\nthe Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been\nconjectured.\n  A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the\nfact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at\nleast not straightforwardly.

Gauge invariance requires the fermion to decouple from the gauge\nfield if it is very heavy. This identifies the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly\nwith the asymptotic limit of the sign reversed mass term. In an instanton\nbackground, the chiral limit $(m = 0)$ of the mass term does not vanish but\nconsists of contributions from fermion zero modes. Space time integral of these\nzero mode contributions exactly cancels, thanks to the Atiyah-Singer index\ntheorem, the integral of the ABJ anomaly and suggests that the Jacobian for\nglobal U(1) chiral transformation is trivial even in an instanton background.\nThis can be realised in the representation of the fermion partition function in\na Weyl basis. The resolution of the strong CP problem is thus achieved in an\naxionless physical world. In chiral gauge theories the fermion partition\nfunction admits of a gauge invariant representation but only at the cost of\nlocality. Implementation of fermion averaging of the gauge current with the\ninvariant partition function yields the current whose covariant derivative is\nthe covariant anomaly. With the covariant current as input one can derive an\nintegrable current whose covariant derivative is the minimal consistent anomaly\nobeying the Wess-Zumino consistency condition. The distinction between the two\ncurrents disappears if either the covariant or the consistent anomaly vanishes.\nThis is realised only if the fermion belongs to an anomaly-free representation\nof the gauge group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 1999 07:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 1999 06:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
