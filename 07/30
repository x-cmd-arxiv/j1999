In this paper, we establish\nthe existence of a rich cluster at the quasar redshift, and study the\nproperties of the cluster galaxies through further detailed analysis of the\nphotometric data. The color distribution of the galaxies in the cluster is\nquite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\\sim 70%) is much larger than in\nintermediate-redshift clusters. Using evolutionary synthesis models, we show\nthat this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amounts\nof star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. Notably,\nthere are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-NIR colors but\nalso show significant UV excess with respect to passive-evolution models. They\ncan be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of star\nformation. The fact that the UV-excess red galaxies are more abundant than the\nquiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in this\ncluster are still forming stars to some extent. However, a sequence of\nquiescent red galaxies is clearly identified on the R-K versus K\ncolor-magnitude (C-M) diagram.

On the assumption that the stellar models\nare accurate, we demonstrate that, if the metallicity is known, the mass\nobtained is a good estimate. However, the age determination can be very\nmisleading because it is significantly (generally different by a factor of two\nto five) dependent on the accretion rate and, for ages less than about one\nmillion years, the initial state of the star. We present a number of accreting\nprotostellar tracks that can be used to determine age if the initial conditions\ncan be determined and the underlying accretion rate has been constant in the\npast. Because of the balance established between the Kelvin-Helmholtz,\ncontraction timescale and the accretion timescale a pre-main-sequence star\nremembers its accretion history. Knowledge of the current accretion rate,\ntogether with an H--R-diagram position gives information about the rate of\naccretion in the past but does not necessarily improve any age estimate. We do\nnot claim that ages obtained by comparison with these particular accreting\ntracks are likely to be any more reliable than those from comparisons with\nnon-accreting tracks. Instead we stress the unreliability of any such\ncomparisons and use the disparities between various tracks to estimate the\nlikely errors in age and mass estimates. We also show how a set of coeval\naccreting objects do not appear coeval when compared with non-accreting tracks.\nInstead accreting pre-main-sequence stars of around a solar mass are likely to\nappear older than those of either smaller or larger mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 1999 10:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The dynamics of the system are described in terms of a\nmany-body potential that confines quarks within hadrons, yet enables the\nhadrons to separate without generating unphysical long-range van der Waals\nforces. The model has ``natural'' low- and high-density limits: it behaves as a\nsystem of isolated hadrons at low density and as a Fermi gas of quarks at high\ndensity. We show that the system exhibits a transition to strange matter\ncharacterized by an increase in the length-scale for confinement. Yet the small\nincrease at the transition region --- of only ten percent --- suggests that\nclustering correlations remain strong well into the strange-matter domain. Our\nresults put into question descriptions of strange matter in terms of\nnoninteracting, or weakly interacting, quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 1999 19:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
