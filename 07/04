Our work is\nmotivated by the existence of a potentially crystallized DAV, BPM 37093, and\nthe expectation that digital surveys in progress will yield many more such\nmassive pulsators.\n  A crystallized core makes possible a new class of oscillations, the torsional\nmodes, although we expect these modes to couple at most weakly to any motions\nin the fluid and therefore to remain unobservable. The p-modes should be\naffected at the level of a few percent in period, but are unlikely to be\npresent with observable amplitudes in crystallizing white dwarfs any more than\nthey are in the other ZZ Ceti's. Most relevant to the observed light variations\nin white dwarfs are the g-modes. We find that the kinetic energy of these modes\nis effectively excluded from the crystallized cores of our models. As\nincreasing crystallization pushes these modes farther out from the center, the\nmean period spacing between radial overtones increases substantially with the\ncrystallized mass fraction. In addition, the degree and structure of mode\ntrapping is affected. The fact that some periods are strongly affected by\nchanges in the crystallized mass fraction while others are not suggests that we\nmay be able to disentangle the effects of crystallization from those due to\ndifferent surface layer masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 1999 17:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Using a perturbation of FRW metric in harmonic\ngauge, we show that the relativistic effects reduce to light cone effects\nincluding the expansion of the universe. Within the Newtonian gravitation, the\nlinear perturbation theory of large scale structure formation predicts the\npeculiar velocity field to be directly proportional to gravitational force due\nto the matter distribution. The corresponding relation between peculiar\nvelocity field and density contrast has been given by Peebles. Using the\ngeneral relativistic perturbation we have developed, this familiar relation is\nmodified by doing the calculation on the light cone in contrast to the usual\nprocedure of taking a space-like slice defined at a definite time. The velocity\nand density--spectrum are compared to the familiar Newtonian expressions.
