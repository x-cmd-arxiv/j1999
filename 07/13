In this paper, we show that\nthe scale behavior of $M/L$ ratio is closely related to the scaling of cosmic\nstructures larger than clusters. The scale dependence of the $M/L$ ratio can be\ndetermined by comparing the observed scaling of richness function (RF) of\nmulti-scale identified objects with the model-predicted scaling of mass\nfunction (MF) of large scale structures. Using the multi-scale identified\nclusters from IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy survey, we have made comparisons of the\nobserved RF scaling of IRAS $r_{cl}$-clusters with the MF scalings given by\nsimulations of three popular models SCDM, LCDM and OCDM.

They are therefore the objects of choice to study the initial\nevolution of extragalactic radio sources. Observational constraints on the\nluminosity evolution of young radio sources have mainly come from number\ndensity statistics and source size distributions, indicating that young sources\nshould decrease in luminosity by a factor ~10 as they evolve to extended\nobjects. We argue that the growth or decay in radio power of the individual\nobjects has a strong influence on the slope of their collective luminosity\nfunction. This has led to a new method of constraining the evolution of young\nsources by comparing their luminosity function to that of large extended\nobjects. The luminosity function of GPS sources is shown to be flatter than\nthat of extended objects. This is consistent with the proposed scenario that\nyoung sources increase in radio luminosity and large size radio sources\ndecrease in luminosity with time, but larger homogeneous samples are needed.\nThe new large area radio surveys and the current sensitivity and flexibility of\nVLBI networks allow the construction and investigation of such large and\nhomogeneous samples of young sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 1999 14:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For example, we find rather elegant formulae for double\nbarrier options with moving barriers, continuous dividends and all possible\nconfigurations of the barriers. The strength of the formalism reveals itself in\nthe ease with which these prices can be derived.

In addition to the traditional mechanisms, like the\nneutrino mass, the admixture of right handed currents etc, it may occur due to\nthe R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY) interactions.
