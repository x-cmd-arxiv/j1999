(1995) provides an intriguing application of the\nunified model of Seyfert nuclei to a galaxy in which there is known to be an\nedge-on, rotating disk of molecular gas surrounding the nucleus. Unlike most\nSeyfert nuclei, however, NGC 4258 has strongly polarized narrow emission lines.\nTo further investigate the origin of the polarized emission, we have obtained\nspectropolarimetric observations of the NGC 4258 nucleus at the Keck-II\ntelescope. The narrow-line polarizations range from 1.0% for [S II] 6716 to\n13.9% for the [O II] 7319,7331 blend, and the position angle of polarization is\noriented nearly parallel to the projected plane of the masing disk. A\ncorrelation between critical density and degree of polarization is detected for\nthe forbidden lines, indicating that the polarized emission arises from\nrelatively dense (n_e > 10^4 cm^-3) gas. An archival Hubble Space Telescope\nnarrow-band [O III] image shows that the narrow-line region has a compact,\nnearly unresolved core, implying a FWHM size of <2.5 pc. We discuss the\npossibility that the polarized emission might arise from the accretion disk\nitself and become polarized by scattering within the disk atmosphere. A more\nlikely scenario is an obscuring torus or strongly warped disk surrounding the\ninner portion of a narrow-line region which is strongly stratified in density.\nThe compact size of the narrow-line region implies that the obscuring structure\nmust be smaller than ~2.5 pc in diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 1999 16:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this framework, we\nregard atomic diffusion as a microscopic process described by two independent\nkinematic variables: (i) the atomic flux, which reckons the local motion of\natoms relative to the motion of the underlying lattice, and (ii) the time-rate\nof the atomic density, which encompasses nonlocal interactions between\nmigrating atoms and characterizes the kinematics of phase separation. We\nintroduce generalized forces power-conjugate to each of these rates and require\nthat these forces satisfy ancillary microbalances distinct from the\nconventional balance involving the forces that expend power over the rate at\nwhich the lattice deforms. A mechanical version of the second law, which takes\nthe form of an energy imbalance accounting for all power expenditures\n(including those due to the atomic diffusion and phase separation), is used to\nderive restrictions on the constitutive equations. With these restrictions, the\nmicrobalance involving the forces conjugate to the atomic flux provides a\ngeneralization of the usual constitutive relation between the atomic flux and\nthe gradient of the diffusion potential, a relation that in conjunction with\nthe atomic balance yields a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 1999 12:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nmodel also allows for both point and line defects in the bulk of the lattice\nand at interfaces, and the kinematics of such defects is discussed in some\ndetail. A Gibbsian variational argument is used to derive the necessary bulk\nand interfacial conditions for multi-phase equilibrium (crystal-crystal and\ncrystal-melt) where the allowed lattice variations involve the creation and\ntransport of defects in the bulk and at the phase interface. An interfacial\nenergy, assumed to depend on the interfacial dislocation density and the\norientation of the interface with respect to the lattices of both phases, is\nalso included in the analysis. Previous equilibrium results based on nonlinear\nelastic models for incoherent and coherent interfaces are recovered as special\ncases for when the lattice distortion is constrained to coincide with the\nmacroscopic deformation gradient, thereby excluding bulk dislocations. The\nformulation is purely spatial and needs no recourse to a fixed reference\nconfiguration or an elastic-plastic decomposition of the strain. Such a\ndecomposition can be introduced however through an incremental elastic\ndeformation superposed onto an already dislocated state, but leads to\nadditional equilibrium conditions.

These are diagrams containing\none or more energetic particles that suffer very little recoil in their\ninteractions. When recoil is completely neglected, a decomposition formula can\nbe proven. This formula is a generalization of the well-known eikonal formula,\nto non-abelian interactions. It expresses the amplitude as a sum of products of\nirreducible amplitudes, with each irreducible amplitude being the amplitude to\nemit one, or several mutually interacting, quasi-particles. For abelian\ninteraction a quasi-particle is nothing but the original boson, so this\ndecomposition formula reduces to the eikonal formula. In non-abelian situations\neach quasi-particle can be made up of many bosons, though always with a total\nquantum number identical to that of a single boson. This decomposition enables\ncertain amplitudes of all orders to be summed up into an exponential form, and\nit allows subleading contributions of a certain kind, which is difficult to\nreach in the usual way, to be computed. For bosonic emissions from a heavy\nsource with many constituents, a quasi-particle amplitude turns out to be an\namplitude in which all bosons are emitted from the same constituent. For\nhigh-energy parton-parton scattering in the near-forward direction, the\nquasi-particle turns out to be the Reggeon, and this formalism shows clearly\nwhy gluons reggeize but photons do not. The ablility to compute subleading\nterms in this formalism allows the BFKL-Pomeron amplitude to be extrapolated to\nasymptotic energies, in a unitary way preserving the Froissart bound. We also\nconsider recoil corrections for abelian interactions in order to accommodate\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 1999 14:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
