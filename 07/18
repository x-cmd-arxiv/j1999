This method\nhas been applied to the HI distribution of NGC4449. In a first step the fast\nrestricted N-body models were used to confine a region in parameter space\nreproducing the main observational features. In a second step a genetic\nalgorithm is introduced which allows for an automated search in parameter space\nas well as for a uniqueness test of special parameter sets. Using artificial\ndata I show that the genetic algorithm reliably recovers orbital parameters. In\nthe third step the results of the restricted N-body models are compared with\ndetailed self-consistent N-body simulations. In the case of NGC4449 the\napplicability of the simple restricted N-body calculations is demonstrated.\n  NGC4449 is an active star-forming dwarf galaxy of Magellanic type. From radio\nobservations van Woerden et al. (1975) found an extended HI-halo around NGC4449\nwhich is at least a factor of 10 larger than the optical diameter. More\nrecently, Bajaja et al. (1994) and Hunter et al. (1998) discerned details in\nthe HI-halo: a disc-like feature around the center of NGC4449 and a lopsided\narm structure. In a series of simulations it is demonstrated that the main\nfeatures can be obtained by a gravitational interaction between NGC4449 and\nDDO125, another nearby dwarf galaxy. According to these calculations the\nclosest approach between both galaxies happened 350 Myr ago at a minimum\ndistance of 25 kpc on a nearly parabolic orbit. In case of the encounter\nscenario, the dynamical mass of DDO125 should not be smaller than 10% of\nNGC4449's mass. The origin of this disc is still unclear, but it might be\ncaused by a previous interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 1999 16:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
