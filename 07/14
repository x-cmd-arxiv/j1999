Summarizing past results,\nit is shown that the transport effects can account for the observations by\ninhomogeneous loops where there is a strong field convergence and/or density\nenhancement at the top of the flaring loop. Scattering by plasma turbulence at\nthe acceleration site or pancake type pitch angle distribution of the\naccelerated electrons can also give rise to enhanced emission at the loop tops.\nThese could be a natural consequence of acceleration by plasma waves. This\npaper considers a general case of stochastic scattering and acceleration that\nleads to an isotropic pitch angle distribution and an enhanced emission from\nthe loop tops or the acceleration site.\n  Following the formalism developed in earlier papers the strength and the\nspectrum of the radiation expected from the acceleration site and the foot\npoints are evaluated and their dependence on the parameters describing the\nacceleration process and the flare plasma are determined. The theoretical ratio\nof these two intensities and relative values of their spectral indices are\ncompared with the YOHKOH observations, demonstrating that the above mentioned\nparameters can be constrained with such observations.
