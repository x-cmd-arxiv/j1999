However, it is only as this background at 850 microns has been\nresolved with direct submillimeter imaging that we have seen that it is created\nby a population of ultraluminous (or near ultraluminous) infrared galaxies\n(ULIGs) which appear to lie at relatively high redshifts (z>1). Mapping the\nredshift evolution of this major portion of the universal star formation has\nbeen difficult because of the poor submillimeter spatial resolution, but this\ndifficulty can be overcome by using extremely deep cm continuum radio\nobservations to obtain precise astrometric information since the bulk of the\nbrighter submillimeter sources have detectable radio counterparts. However,\nwith this precise position information available, we find that most of the\nsubmillimeter sources are extremely faint in the optical and near infrared\n(I>>24 and K=21-22) and inaccessible to optical spectroscopy. Rough photometric\nredshift estimates can be made from combined radio and submillimeter energy\ndistributions. We shall refer to this procedure as millimetric redshift\nestimation to distinguish it from photometric estimators in the optical and\nnear IR. These estimators place the bulk of the submillimeter population at\nz=1-3, where it corresponds to the high redshift tail of the faint cm radio\npopulation. While still preliminary, the results suggest that the submillimeter\npopulation appears to dominate the star formation in this redshift range by\nalmost an order of magnitude over the mostly distinct populations selected in\nthe optical-ultraviolet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 1999 01:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On the contrary, downfolding is now more efficient\nand the formalism is simpler and closer to that of screened multiple-scattering\ntheory. The NMTO method allows one to solve the single-electron Schroedinger\nequation for a MT-potential -in which the MT-wells may overlap- using basis\nsets which are arbitrarily minimal. The substantial increase in accuracy over\nthe LMTO-ASA method is achieved by substitution of the energy-dependent partial\nwaves by so-called kinked partial waves, which have tails attached to them, and\nby using these kinked partial waves at N+1 arbitrary energies to construct the\nset of NMTOs. For N=1 and the two energies chosen infinitesimally close, the\nNMTOs are simply the 3rd-generation LMTOs. Increasing N, widens the energy\nwindow, inside which accurate results are obtained, and increases the range of\nthe orbitals, but it does not increase the size of the basis set and therefore\ndoes not change the number of bands obtained. The price for reducing the size\nof the basis set through downfolding, is a reduction in the number of bands\naccounted for and -unless N is increased- a narrowing of the energy window\ninside which these bands are accurate. A method for obtaining orthonormal NMTO\nsets is given and several applications are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 1999 13:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

By this way we allow to share\ncorrelations between density functional and collisional dissipative\ncontributions appropriate for the special treatment. We present results for\ncollective modes like the plasmon in plasma systems and the giant resonance in\nnuclei. The collisions lead in general to an enhanced damping of collective\nmodes. If the collision frequency is close to the frequency of the collective\nmode, resonance occurs and the collective mode is enhanced showing a\ncollisional narrowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 1999 11:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 1999 12:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 1999 07:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

By explaining\nhow these particles acquire phase at different rates, we explain why these\nparticles have different masses. Any free particle spin 1/2 wave function is a\nsum of plane waves with spin parallel to velocity. Each plane wave, a pair of\n2-component rotation eigenvectors, can be associated with a 2x2 matrix\nrepresentation of rotations in a Euclidean space without disturbing the plane\nwave's space-time properties. In a space with more than four dimensions, only\nrotations in a 4d subspace can be represented. So far all is well known. Now\nconsider that unrepresented rotations do not have eigenvectors, do not make\nplane waves, and do not contribute phase. The particles e, $\\pi,$ and p are\nassigned rotations in a 4d subspace of 16d, rotations in an 8d subspace of 12d,\nand rotations in a 12d subspace of 12d, respectively. The electron 4d subspace,\nassumed to be as likely to align with any one 4d subspace as with any other,\nproduces phase when aligned with the represented 4d subspace in 16d. Similarly,\nwe calculate the likelihood that a 4d subspace of the pion's 8d space aligns\nwith the represented 4d subspace in 12d. The represented 4d subspace is\ncontained in the proton's 12d space, so the proton always acquires phase.
