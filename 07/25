Surprisingly, most of these wave patterns are at\nintervals of about 1 cm. The reason for this uniformity of interval has not\nbeen clarified.

This theory is given by thermal diffusion\nin thin water layer streams flowing along the icicles. The streams change the\ntemperature distribution and control waves of short wavelengths. The specific\nwavelength (about 1 cm) can be determined by Laplace instability of the heat\nfield in the atmosphere and by the thermal diffusion effect in thin-layer\nstreams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 1999 03:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2001 05:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 11:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2001 11:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2001 01:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 07:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2001 04:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As the metric loses its\nmeaning, it makes sense to consider Schrodinger's three generic types of\nmanifolds - unconnected differentiable, affinely connected, and metrically\nconnected - as a temporal sequence following the big bang. Hence one should\nquantize the gravitational field on general differentiable manifolds or on\naffinely connected manifolds.
