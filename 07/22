The\nobservation covers a time interval centered on eclipse of the X-ray pulsar by\nthe companion. The spectrum exhibits two distinct sets of discrete features:\n(1) recombination lines and radiative recombination continua from mostly H- and\nHe-like species produced by photoionization in an extended stellar wind; and\n(2) fluorescent K-shell lines associated with near-neutral species also present\nin the circumsource medium. Using a detailed spectral model that explicitly\naccounts for the recombination cascade kinetics for each of the constituent\ncharge states, we are able to obtain a statistically acceptable (chi_r^2=0.88)\nfit to the observed spectrum and to derive emission measures associated with\nthe individual K-shell ions of several elements. We find a best-fit mass loss\nrate of ~2.7 x 10^-7 M-solar/yr, which is approximately a factor of 10 lower\nthan previous estimates of the mass loss rate for the Vela X-1 companion star,\nwhich have primarily been determined from P Cygni profiles, and X-ray\nabsorption measurements. We argue that this discrepancy can be reconciled if\nthe X-ray irradiated portion of the wind in Vela X-1 is structurally\ninhomogeneous, consisting of hundreds of cool, dense clumps embedded in a\nhotter, more ionized gas. Most of the mass is contained in the clumps, while\nmost of the wind volume (>95%) is occupied by the highly ionized component. We\nshow quantitatively, that this interpretation is also consistent with the\npresence of the X-ray fluorescent lines in the ASCA spectrum, which are\nproduced in the cooler, clumped component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 1999 16:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
