In\nthis CMD, there are very few stars at the positions of the HBs of the five\nglobular clusters in Fornax, which suggests that only a very small fraction of\nthe field population resembles the clusters in age and chemical composition.\nThe large span in luminosity of the main-sequence suggests that star formation\nbegan in the field about 12 Gyrs ago and continued to about 0.5 Gyr ago. There\nare separate subgiant branches in the CMD, which indicate that the star\nformation was not continuous but occurred in bursts.

Small amplitude perturbations are studied in both Keplerian and\nslightly non Keplerian discs, and we find that the SPH results can be\nreasonably well fitted by those of the linear theory. The main results of these\ncalculations are: (1) the warp in Keplerian discs when `alpha' < H/r propagates\nwith little dispersion and damps at a rate expected from estimates of the code\nviscosity, (2) warps evolve diffusively when `alpha' > H/r, (3) the non\nKeplerian discs exhibit a substantially more dispersive behaviour of the warps.\nInitially imposed higher amplitude nonlinear warping disturbances were studied\nin Keplerian discs. The results indicate that nonlinear warps can lead to the\nformation of shocks, and that the evolution of the warp becomes less wave-like\nand more diffusive in character.

The metallicity-mass\nrelation, or equivalently, the color-magnitude relation holds not only for the\ncentral part but also for the whole part of galaxies. Using Mg2 and Fe1, we\nfind <[Mg/Fe]> = +0.2 in most of ellipticals. <[Mg/Fe]> shows no correlation\nwith galaxy mass tracers. This can be most naturally explained if the star\nformation had stopped in ellipticals before the bulk of Type Ia supernovae\nbegan to explode. Ellipticals can have significantly different metallicity\ngradients and <[Fe/H]> even if they have the same galaxy mass. This may result\nfrom galaxy mergers, but no evidence is found from presently available data to\nsupport the same origin for metallicity gradients, the scatters around\nmetallicity-mass relation, and dynamical disturbances. This may suggest that\nthe scatters have their origin at the formation epoch of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 1999 12:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Firstly, we clearly identify the vortex phase\ntransition and show that, when the magnetic field is along the twin boundaries\n(within about 2 degrees), the vortex solid is a Bose glass.\n  Secondly, the effects of twins on the vortex dynamics are studied by\nmeasuring the direction and magnitude of the total electric field while\nrotating the current in the ab plane. We observe a partially guided vortex\nmotion along the dominating twin plane family, already apparent in the vortex\nliquid, and becoming more and more pronounced as the temperature or the\nmagnetic field is reduced. There is no change related to the vortex phase\ntransition.\n  Finally, the mixed state Hall effect is studied, with particular focus given\nto the vortex phase transition. We show that the Hall resistivity scaling law\nrho_xy=A*rho_xx^b remains unchanged in the vortex solid phase. For a magnetic\nfield along the twins, the exponent is b=2, corresponding to a constant Hall\nconductivity. For a tilted magnetic field, we find b=1.4. In this case, the\nHall conductivity changes sharply at the vortex lattice melting, its slope\nbecoming much larger in the vortex solid. This effect is strongly current\ndependent, and thus demonstrates that the Hall conductivity is pinning\ndependent, hopefully solving a long term controversy. We also thoroughly review\nthe experimental data on the mixed state Hall effect, and discuss some\ntheoretical models concerning both the anomaly (a sign reversal of the Hall\neffect) and the scaling law.

The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 1999 14:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2000 02:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
