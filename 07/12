In the\ntheory the importance of the discreteness of electronic charge in mesoscopic\nelectric circuit is addressed. The mesoscopic LC-design is quantized in accord\nwith the charge discreteness. The uncertainty relation for electric charge and\ncurrent is given. Because the stationary Schr\\\"odinger equation is turned to be\nMathieu equation in $p$-representation, the wave function and energy spectrum\nis formally solved. As further applications, the persistent current is obtained\nby considering the mesoscopic ring as a pure L-design. The Coulomb blockade\nphenomenon occurs when applying the theory to the pure C-design. Concerning the\ntime evolution of the states for mesoscopic electric circuit, we are able to\nstudy it by the method of characteristics. In order to study the dissipative\neffect in the circuit, we use density-matrix formulation. In this formulation,\nseveral type of ``off diagonal'' dissipations are expected to be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 1999 13:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The theory developed is shown to be\nconsistent with the general principles of the canonical quantization of\nelectromagnetic field in a medium. Starting from the first principles of QED we\nhave derived the general system of Maxwell-Bloch equations for atomic creation\nand annihilation operators and the propagation equation for the laser field\nwhich can be used for the self-consistent analysis of various linear and\nnonlinear phenomena in atom optics at high densities of the atomic system. All\nknown equations which are used for the description of the behaviour of an\nultracold atomic ensemble in a radiation field can be obtained from our general\nsystem of equations in a low-density limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 1999 07:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
