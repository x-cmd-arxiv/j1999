The analytical approach includes the\neffects of the gravitational wake, of the tidal deformation and the shift of\nthe barycenter of the primary, so unifying the local versus global\ninterpretation of dynamical friction. Sizes, masses, orbital energies and\neccentricities are chosen as expected in hierarchical clustering models. We\nfind that in general the drag force in self-gravitating backgrounds is weaker\nthan in uniform media and that the orbital decay is not accompanied by a\nsignificant circularization. We also show that the dynamical friction time\nscale is weakly dependent on the initial circularity. We provide a fitting\nformula for the decay time that includes the effect of mass and angular\nmomentum loss. Live satellites with dense cores can survive disruption up to an\nHubble time within the primary, notwithstanding the initial choice of orbital\nparameters. Dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way, like Sagittarius A\nand Fornax, have already suffered mass stripping and, with their present\nmasses, the sinking times exceed 10 Gyr even if they are on very eccentric\norbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 1999 16:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Calculations of the\nexplosive nucleosynthesis and the matter mixing in a jet-like explosion are\nperformed and their results are compared with the observations of SN 1987A. It\nis shown that the jet-like explosion model is favored because the radioactive\nnuclei 44Ti is produced in a sufficient amount to explain the observed\nbolometric luminosity at 3600 days after the explosion. It is also shown that\nthe observed line profiles of Fe[II] are well reproduced by the jet-like\nexplosion model. In particular, the fast moving component travelling at\n(3000-4000) km/s is well reproduced, which has not been reproduced by the\nspherical explosion models. Moreover, we conclude that the favored degree of a\njet-like explosion to explain the tail of the light curve is consistent with\nthe one favored in the calculation of the matter mixing. The concluded ratio of\nthe velocity along to the polar axis relative to that in the equatorial plane\nat the Si/Fe interface is about 2:1. This conclusion will give good constraints\non the calculations of the dynamics of the collapse-driven supernova. The\nasymmetry of the observed line profiles of Fe[II] can be explained when the\nassumption of the equatorial symmetry of the system is removed, which can be\ncaused by the asymmetry of the jet-like explosion with respect to the\nequatorial plane. In the case of SN 1987A, the jet on the north pole has to be\nstronger than that on the south pole in order to reproduce the observed\nasymmetric line profiles. Such an asymmetry may also be the origin of the\npulsar kick. When we believe some theories that cause such an asymmetric\nexplosion, the proto -neutron star born in SN 1987A is moving in the southern\npart of the remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 1999 14:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 1999 05:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 1999 08:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 1999 15:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 1999 18:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 1999 15:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2000 08:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

In contrast to the classical technique of DeMillo, Lipton, Schwartz,\nand Zippel, this methodology can decrease the error probability by increasing\nthe precision of the approximations instead of using more random bits.\nConsequently, randomized algorithms that use the classical technique can\ngenerally be improved using the new methodology. To demonstrate the\nmethodology, we discuss two nontrivial applications. The first is to decide\nwhether a graph has a perfect matching in parallel. Our new NC algorithm uses\nfewer random bits while doing less work than the previously best NC algorithm\nby Chari, Rohatgi, and Srinivasan. The second application is to test the\nequality of two multisets of integers. Our new algorithm improves upon the\npreviously best algorithms by Blum and Kannan and can speed up their checking\nalgorithm for sorting programs on a large range of inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 1999 23:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2000 14:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analytic\nexpressions for the friction and mass parameters related to the low-enegy\nsurface excitations are derived and their value is compared to values given by\nother models. Both similarities and differences are found with respect to the\nother approaches, however the close agreement obtained in many cases with one\nof the other models suggests that, in spite of some important differences, the\ntwo approaches are substantially equivalent. The formalism based on the Vlasov\nequation is more transparent since it leads to analytical expressions that can\nbe a basis for further improvement of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 1999 15:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is called\nCellular Automata (CA) theory, which is the most massively parallel computer\nmodel currently known to science. We maintain that at the tiniest distance and\ntime scales the universe is completely deterministic, and utterly simple. Our\nuniverse is a Cellular Automaton consisting of a huge array of cells capable of\nstoring numeric information. These cells form a vast, 3D 'geometric' CA, where\neach cell has 26 surrounding neighboring cells that influence the state of a\ngiven cell. CA theory directly implies that all the laws of physics must result\nfrom interactions that are strictly local, therefore forbidding any form of\naction at a distance. CA theory suggests that space, time, matter, energy, and\nmotion are all the same thing: the end result of information changing state in\nthe CA. The CA model automatically contains an inherent maximum speed limit for\nwhich information can be moved from place to place.We propose that light\n(photon) motion is the fixed, simple shifting of a photon information pattern\nfrom cell to adjacent cell at every 'clock cycle'. Thus photons 'travel' only\nat one fixed speed, which is unaffected by any possible source motion. By\nadopting absolute CA space and time coordinates for the description of a pair\nof observers in inertial reference frames with a relative velocity 'v', then\nthe Lorentz transformation follows mathematically. We explore the ramifications\nof this CA model for all of physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 1999 14:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As such they can at most provide us with two\nsubjective choices for the meaning of 'counterfactual statements' in quantum\nmechanics. We shall show that the word 'counterfactual' is in fact\ninappropriate here and should be replaced by the word 'hypothetical'. Mermin's\nchoice imposes a strictly contextual meaning based upon an interpretation of\ncounterfactuality which he used to refute, without proof as we shall see,\nStapp's logical proof [3] of non-locality in quantum theory. In linguistic\ntheory both authors' choices of meaning: counterfactual versus hypothetical are\nequally acceptable and therefore some of the issues they discussed lie outside\nthe domain of physics. The issues they discussed are further confused by the\nfact that in his reply Stapp [2] seems to have adopted Mermin's counterfactual\ninterpretation against his own original [3] hypothetical interpretation. In the\nrest of this paper we shall adopt the hypothetical sense of Stapp's original\nstatements but we modify his crucial statement LOC2 appropriately, then\nfollowing his argumentations, we shall show that there is no conflict between\nrelativity and quantum mechanics.
