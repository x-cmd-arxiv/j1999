We find that the\nvelocity bias pvb measured as a ratio of pairwise velocities of the halos to\nthat of the dark matter evolves with time and depends on scale.

We first clarify the terminology and recapitulate the\nbasic models of population genetics, which describe the evolution of the\ncomposition of a population under the joint action of the various evolutionary\nforces. Building on these foundations, we specify the ingredients explicitly,\nnamely, the various mutation models and fitness landscapes.

These predict\nupper limits for the mutation rate above which mutation can no longer be\ncontrolled by selection, the most important phenomena being error thresholds,\nMuller's ratchet, and mutational meltdowns. Error thresholds are deterministic\nphenomena, whereas Muller's ratchet requires the stochastic component brought\nabout by finite population size. Mutational meltdowns additionally rely on an\nexplicit model of population dynamics, and describe the extinction of\npopulations. Special emphasis is put on the mutual relationship between these\nphenomena.

For classical information\ntransmission via quantum channels we give a new proof of the coding theorem,\nand prove the strong converse, even under the extended model of nonstationary\nchannels. As a by-product we obtain a new proof of the famous Holevo bound.\nThen multi-user systems are investigated, and the capacity region for the\nquantum multiple access channel is determined. The last chapter contains a\npreliminary discussion of some models of compression of correlated quantum\nsources, and a proposal for a program to obtain operational meaning for quantum\nconditional entropy. An appendix features the introduction of a notation and\ncalculus of entropy in quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 1999 09:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
