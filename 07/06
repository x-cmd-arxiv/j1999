Initial examinations paid attention to far\nunstable nuclei with magic neutron numbers related to r-process peaks, while\npresent activities are centered on the evolution of shell effects with the\ndistance from the valley of stability. We first show in site-independent\napplications the effect of both types of nuclear properties on r-process\nabundances. Then, we explore the results of calculations related to two\ndifferent `realistic' astrophysical sites, (i) the supernova neutrino wind and\n(ii) neutron star mergers. We close with a list of remaining theoretical and\nexperimental challenges needed to overcome for a full understanding of the\nnature of the r-process, and the role CERN/ISOLDE can play in this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 1999 15:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For a Riemannian manifold M admitting a compact Lie group G as\nan isometry group, the quotient space Q = M/G is not a smooth manifold in\ngeneral but stratified into a collection of smooth manifolds of various\ndimensions. If the action of the compact group G is free, M is made into a\nprincipal fiber bundle with structure group G. In this case, reduced quantum\nsystems are set up as quantum systems on the associated vector bundles over Q =\nM/G. This idea of reduction fails, if the action of G on M is not free.\nHowever, the Peter-Weyl theorem works well for reducing quantum systems on M.\nWhen applied to the space of wave functions on M, the Peter-Weyl theorem\nprovides the decomposition of the space of wave functions into spaces of\nequivariant functions on M, which are interpreted as Hilbert spaces for reduced\nquantum systems on Q. The concept of connection on a principal fiber bundle is\ngeneralized to be defined well on the stratified manifold M. Then the reduced\nLaplacian is well defined as a self-adjoint operator with the boundary\nconditions on singular sets of lower dimensions.
