Our measurements yield a\npattern speed of 0.21+/-0.06 km/s/arcsec (8.0+/-2.4 km/s/kpc for D=5.3 Mpc), in\ndisagreement with the general view that corotation in barred disks lies just\noutside the end of the bar, but consistent with recent models of barred\ngalaxies with dense dark matter halos.

Because NGC 2915 is isolated, interactions cannot account for the\nstructure observed in the HI disk. We also demonstrate that the low observed\ndisk surface density and the location of the pseudo-rings make it unlikely that\nswing amplification or bar-driven spiral arms could explain the bar and spiral\npattern.\n  Based on the similarity of the dark matter and HI surface density profiles,\nwe discuss the possibility of dark matter distributed in a disk and following\nclosely the HI distribution. The disk then becomes unstable and can naturally\nform a bar and spiral pattern. However, this explanation is hard to reconcile\nwith some properties of NGC 2915. We also consider the effect of a massive and\nextended triaxial dark matter halo with a rotating figure. The existence of\nsuch halos is supported by CDM simulations showing strongly triaxial dark halos\nwith slow figure rotation. The observed structure of the HI disk can then arise\nthrough forcing by the rotating triaxial figure.

A model for the\nnumerical calculation of the response of a degenerate two-level system to the\naction of an arbitrarily intense resonant pump field and a weak probe in the\npresence of a magnetic field is presented. The model is valid for arbitrary\nvalues of the total angular momentum of the lower and upper levels and for any\nchoice of the polarizations of the optical waves. Closed and open degenerate\ntwo-level systems are considered. Predictions for probe absorption and\ndispersion, field generation by four-wave-mixing, population modulation and\nZeeman optical pumping are derived. On all these observables, sub-natural-width\ncoherence resonances are predicted and their spectroscopic features are\ndiscussed.

The implementation of a quantum logic gate\nimposes certain constraints on the motion of those spins not directly involved\nin that gate, the so-called \"spectator\" spins; they must be returned to their\ninitial states at the end of the sequence. As a result, a homonuclear spin\nsystem where there is appreciable coupling between every pair of spins would\nseem to require a refocusing scheme that doubles in complexity and duration for\nevery additional spectator spin. Fortunately, for the more realistic practical\ncase where long-range spin-spin couplings can be neglected, simpler refocusing\nschemes can be devised where the overall duration of the sequence remains\nconstant and the number of soft pulses increases only linearly with the number\nof spectator spins.
