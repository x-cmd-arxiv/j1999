We consider the kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from mildly nonlinear large-scale structure and show\nthat it is a natural extension of the perturbative Vishniac effect. If the gas\ntraces the dark matter to overdensities of order 10, as expected from\nsimulations, this effect is at least comparable to the Vishniac effect at\narcminute scales. On smaller scales, it may be used to study the thermal\nhistory-dependent clustering of the gas. Polarization is generated through\nThomson scattering of primordial quadrupole anisotropies, kinetic (second order\nDoppler) quadrupole anisotropies and intrinsic scattering quadrupole\nanisotropies. Small scale polarization results from the density and ionization\nmodulation of these sources. These effects generically produce comparable E and\nB-parity polarization, but of negligible amplitude (0.001-0.01 uK) in adiabatic\nCDM models. However, the primordial and kinetic quadrupoles are observationally\ncomparable today so that a null detection of B-polarization would set\nconstraints on the evolution and coherence of the velocity field. Conversely, a\ndetection of a cosmological B-polarization even at large angles does not\nnecessarily imply the presence of gravity waves or vorticity. For these\ncalculations, we develop an all-sky generalization of the Limber equation that\nallows for an arbitrary local angular dependence of the source for both scalar\nand symmetric trace-free tensor fields on the sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 1999 20:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 21:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Various spatial geometries are considered, with emphasis on\nlow-dimensional (quasi-1D and 2D) systems. Calculations are based on the\nsupermatrix sigma-model approach. The method reproduces, in so-called zero-mode\napproximation, the universal random matrix theory (RMT) results for the\nenergy-level and eigenfunction fluctuations. Going beyond this approximation\nallows us to study system-specific deviations from universality, which are\ndetermined by the diffusive classical dynamics in the system. These deviations\nare especially strong in the far ``tails'' of the distribution function of the\neigenfunction amplitudes (as well as of some related quantities, such as local\ndensity of states, relaxation time, etc.). These asymptotic ``tails'' are\ngoverned by anomalously localized states which are formed in rare realizations\nof the random potential. The deviations of the level and eigenfunction\nstatistics from their RMT form strengthen with increasing disorder and become\nespecially pronounced at the Anderson metal-insulator transition. In this\nregime, the wave functions are multifractal, while the level statistics\nacquires a scale-independent form with distinct critical features. Fluctuations\nof the conductance and of the local intensity of a classical wave radiated by a\npoint-like source in the quasi-1D geometry are also studied within the\nsigma-model approach. For a ballistic system with rough surface an\nappropriately modified (``ballistic'') sigma-model is used. Finally, the\ninterplay of the fluctuations and the electron-electron interaction in small\nsamples is discussed, with application to the Coulomb blockade spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 1999 18:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2000 11:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We here show that signature change\ncan also avoid the singularity of gravitational collapse.
