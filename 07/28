Concentrating on non-interacting galaxies in our sample for which\nmorphological information can be obtained, we find that Seyfert hosts are\nbarred more often (79% +/- 7.5%) than the non-active galaxies in our control\nsample (59% +/- 9%), a result which is at the 2.5 sigma significance level.

Whether a statistically significant value of the\ncosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminosities\nof SNe Ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic\nevolutions. Here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the\nChandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models of SNe Ia. We identify the\nprogenitor's evolution and population with two channels: (1) the WD+RG\n(red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In\nthese channels, the strong wind from accreting white dwarfs plays a key role,\nwhich yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. We then\naddress the questions whether the nature of SNe Ia depends systematically on\nenvironmental properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor system\nand whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We suggest that the\nvariation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O WD (or the variation of\nthe initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of SNe Ia. This\nmodel can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brighness on the galaxy\ntypes. Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia\nprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a\ncomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 1999 17:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we investigate, via Monte Carlo simulations, the\ncanonical lattice model of polymer collapse, namely interacting self-avoiding\nwalks, to show that it not only has a distinct collapse transition at finite\ntemperature but that for any finite polymer length this collapse has many\ncharacteristics of a rounded first-order phase transition. However, we also\nshow that there exists a `$\\theta$-point' where the polymer behaves in a simple\nGaussian manner (which is a critical state), to which these finite-size\ntransition temperatures approach as the polymer length is increased. The\nresolution of these seemingly incompatible conclusions involves the argument\nthat the first-order-like rounded transition is scaled away in the\nthermodynamic limit to leave a mean-field second-order transition.

After compactification of the extra dimensions,\nthe resulting Yukawa couplings of the Kaluza-Klein neutrinos to the lepton\ndoublets become naturally very suppressed by a higher-dimensional volume\nfactor, in agreement with phenomenological observations. We show that one-loop\neffects induced by Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, albeit tiny individually, act\ncumulatively in electroweak processes, giving rise to a non-decoupling\nbehaviour for large values of the higher-dimensional Yukawa couplings. Owing to\nthe non-decoupling effects of Kaluza-Klein neutrinos, we can derive stronger\nconstraints on the parameters of the theory that originate from the\nnon-observation of flavour-violating and universality-breaking phenomena, which\ninvolve the W and Z bosons, and the e, $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ leptons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 1999 23:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 1999 09:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 22:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Our implementation of the T-duality\ntransformation rules makes use of adapted background-field parametrizations,\nwhich provide a more geometrically natural and elegant description for the\nduality maps than the ones previously presented. These T-duality rules allow us\nto derive the Green-Schwarz action for the type IIB string in an arbitrary\nbackground of massless NS-NS and R-R bosonic fields, up to O(\\theta^2).\nImplemention of another T-duality transformation on this type IIB action then\nallows us also to derive the Green-Schwarz action for the massive IIA string.\nBy further considering T-duality transformations for backgrounds with the two\nU(1) isometries of a 2-torus, we give a string-theoretic derivation of the\ndirect T-duality relation between the massless and massive type IIA strings. In\naddition, we give an explicit construction of the D=8 SL(3,R)xSL(2,R) invariant\nsupergravity with two mass parameters that form a doublet under the SL(2,R)\nfactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 1999 22:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2002 10:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
