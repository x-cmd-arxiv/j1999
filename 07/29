An unambiguous method for\ncomputing asymmetry is developed, robust for both distant and nearby galaxies.\nBy degrading real galaxy images, we test the reliability of this asymmetry\nmeasure over a range of observational conditions, e.g. spatial resolution and\nsignal-to-noise (S/N). Compared to previous methods, this new algorithm avoids\nthe ambiguity associated with choosing a center by using a minimization method,\nand successfully corrects for variations in S/N. There is, however, a strong\nrelationship between the rotational asymmetry and physical resolution (distance\nat fixed spatial resolution); objects become more symmetric when less\nwell-resolved. We further investigate asymmetry as a function of galactic\nradius an rotation. We find the asymmetry index has a strong radial dependence\nthat differs vastly between Hubble types. As a result, a meaningful asymmetry\nindex must be specified within a well-defined radius representative of the\nphysical galaxy scale. We enumerate several viable alternatives, which excludes\nthe use of isophotes. Asymmetry as a function of angle (A[phi]) is also a\nuseful indicator of ellipticity and higher-order azimuthal structure. In\ngeneral, we show the power of asymmetry as a morphological parameter lies in\nthe strong correlation with (B-V) color for galaxies undergoing normal star\nformation, spanning all Hubble types from ellipticals to irregular galaxies.\nInteracting galaxies do not fall on this asymmetry-color ``fiducial sequence,''\nas these galaxies are too asymmetric for their color.

At the quantitative level, the properties are to a large extent\ndetermined by the radial mode periods. There is only weak dependence on the\nstar metallicity and no apparent dependence on the evolutionary status, that is\non the helium exhaustion in the convective core.\n  In the whole range of RRab and RRc star parameters we find unstable nonradial\nmodes driven by the opacity mechanism. An instability of radial pulsation to a\nresonant excitation of nonradial oscillations is also a common phenomenon in\nboth types. We discuss a possible role of nonradial modes in amplitude\nmodulation observed in certain RR Lyrae stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 1999 12:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
