Distinct from PBHs formed with mass about the horizon mass (Type I),\nthe PBHs with the scaling relation (Type II) can be created with a range of\nmasses at a given formation time. In general, only the case in which the PBH\nformation is concentrated at one epoch has been considered. However, it is\nexpected that PBH formation is possible over a broad range of epochs if the\ndensity fluctuation has a rather large amplitude and smooth scale dependence.\nIn this paper, we study the PBH formation for both types assuming the power\nspectrum of double inflationary models in which the small scale fluctuations\ncould have large amplitudes independent of the CMBR anisotropy. The mass\nspectrum of Type II PBHs is newly constructed without limiting the PBH\nformation period. The double inflationary power spectrum is assumed to be of\ndouble simple power-law which are smoothly connected. Under the assumed power\nspectrum, the accumulation of small PBHs formed at later times is important and\nthe mass range is significantly broadened for both Types. The PBH mass spectra\nare far smoother than the observed MACHO spectrum due to our assumption of a\nsmooth spectrum. In order to fit the observation, a more spiky spectrum is\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 1999 06:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2000 10:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Two non-standard quantum deformations of\n$h_6$, together with their associated quantum universal R-matrix, are\npresented; each of them contains either a quantum harmonic oscillator\nsubalgebra or a quantum gl(2) subalgebra. One-boson representations for these\nquantum two-photon algebras are derived and translated into Fock--Bargmann\nrealizations. In this way, a systematic study of `deformed' states of light in\nquantum optics can be developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 1999 18:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
