The result for this phase is exponential/quasi-exponential\nUVOIR bolometric light curves and often exponential/quasi-exponential broad\nband light curves. A presentation is given of a simple, approximate, analytic\ntreatment of RDE deposition that provides a straightforward understanding of\nthe exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of the UVOIR bolometric luminosity\nand a partial understanding of the exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of\nthe broad band light curves. The treatment reduces to using a normalized\ndeposition function N_{Ni}^{*}(t) as an analysis tool. The one free parameter\nof N_{Ni}^{*}(t) is a fiducial time t_{0} which governs time-varying gamma-ray\noptical depth behavior of a supernova. The N_{Ni}^{*}(t) function is used to\nanalyze the preliminary UVOIR bolometric light curve of SN Ic 1998bw (the\npossible cause of gamma-ray burst GRB980425).

While the\npredicted mass function is reasonably accurate at the high mass end, it has\nmore low mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering.\nThis discrepancy can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed\nto form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical collapse. In the spherical\nmodel, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold\nvalue, delta_sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region,\nand since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size,\ndelta_sc is independent of final mass.

We find here that it is the most X-ray luminous\nstar-forming galaxy yet detected (~10^42 ergs/s). Long-slit optical\nspectroscopy and a deep, high-resolution ROSAT X-ray image show that the\nstarburst is driving a \"superwind\" which accounts for ~20% of the observed soft\n(kT~0.3 keV) X-ray emission. Our model for the broadband X-ray emission of\nNGC3256 contains two additional components: a warm thermal plasma (kT~0.8 keV)\nassociated with the central starburst, and a hard power-law component with an\nenergy index of ~0.7. We find that the input of mechanical energy from the\nstarburst is more than sufficient to sustain the observed level of emission. We\nalso examine possible origins for the power-law component, concluding that\nneither a buried AGN nor the expected population of high-mass X-ray binaries\ncan account for this emission. Inverse-Compton scattering, involving the\ngalaxy's copious flux of infrared photons and the relativistic electrons\nproduced by supernovae, is likely to make a substantial contribution to the\nhard X-ray flux. Such a model is consistent with the observed radio and IR\nfluxes and the radio and X-ray spectral indices. We explore the role of\nX-ray-luminous starbursts in the production of the cosmic X-ray background\nradiation. The number counts and spectral index distribution of the faint radio\nsource population, thought to be dominated by star-forming galaxies, suggest\nthat a significant fraction of the hard X-ray background could arise from\nstarbursts at moderate redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1999 15:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The sign change of the s-wave order\nparameter across the N_T twin boundaries should give cancelations, resulting in\na small $(\\sqrt{N})$ tunneling current. The actual current is larger than this.\nWe present a theory of this unexpectedly large current based upon a surface\neffect: disorder-induced supression of the d-wave component at the (001)\nsurface leads to s-wave coherence across the twin boundaries and a non-random\ntunneling current. We solve the case of an ordered array of d+s and d-s twins,\nand estimate that the twin size at which s-wave surface coherence occurs is\nconsistent with typical sizes observed in experiments. In this picture, there\nis a phase difference of $\\pi/2$ between different surfaces of the material. We\npropose a corner junction experiment to test this picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1999 00:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2000 20:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A condition on the non triviality of the Dixmier logarithmic trace on\nthe above mentioned ideal has been given by Connes in terms of the\ncohomological dimension of the Chern character of the phase of D. In this paper\nwe show that, under suitable regularity conditions on the eigenvalue sequence\nof |D|, the dimension d can be uniquely determined by imposing that |D|^(-d) is\nsingularly traceable, thus providing a geometric measure theoretic definition\nfor d. More precisely, defining d as the inverse of the polynomial order of\n|D|^(-1), the operator |D|^(-d) always produces a singular trace which gives\nrise to a non-trivial integration procedure, even when the logarithmic trace\nfails.

Unlike the case in axisymmetric\nequilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces, helically symmetric $T=T(\\psi)$\nequilibria are over-determined, i.e., in this case the equilibrium equations\nreduce to a set of eight ordinary differential equations with seven surface\nquantities. In addition, it is proved the non-existence of incompressible\nhelically symmetric equilibria with (a) purely helical flows (b) non-parallel\nflows with isothermal magnetic surfaces and the magnetic field modulus being a\nsurface quantity (omnigenous equilibria).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 1999 16:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Counterfactual computation is a process by\nwhich the result of the computation may be learnt without actually running the\ncomputer. Such processes are possible within quantum physics and to achieve\nthis effect, a computer embodying the possibility of running the computation\nmust be available, even though the computation is, in fact, not run. We study\nthe possibilities and limitations of general protocols for the counterfactual\ncomputation of decision problems (where the result r is either 0 or 1). If p(r)\ndenotes the probability of learning the result r ``for free'' in a protocol\nthen one might hope to design a protocol which simultaneously has large p(0)\nand p(1). However we prove that p(0)+p(1) never exceeds 1 in any protocol and\nwe derive further constraints on p(0) and p(1) in terms of N, the number of\ntimes that the computer is not run. In particular we show that any protocol\nwith p(0)+p(1)=1-epsilon must have N tending to infinity as epsilon tends to 0.\nThese general results are illustrated with some explicit protocols for\ncounterfactual computation. We show that \"interaction-free\" measurements can be\nregarded as counterfactual computations, and our results then imply that N must\nbe large if the probability of interaction is to be close to zero. Finally, we\nconsider some ways in which our formulation of counterfactual computation can\nbe generalised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1999 14:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2000 15:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
