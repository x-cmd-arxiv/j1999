In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable\nresult, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate\nthe algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if\nthe exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some\n(small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the\nevaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure\nof the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the\ninput operands are error-free.\n  A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an \"arithmetic filter\". In this paper\nwe develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic\nfilter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the\nprobability of failure of the filter.\n  To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be\nchosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze\nthe two important predicates \"which-side\" and \"insphere\".

The phase shifts and scattering lengths in the S=0 and S=1 cases are\nalso given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 1999 14:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10928). The present\npaper further explores these simulation conditions in order to understand the\nmain factors responsible for the observed surprisingly good agreement with\nexperimental data. It appears that in the case of the EcoRI dodecamer certain\nsequence specific hydration patterns in the minor groove earlier known from\nexperimental data are formed spontaneously in the course of MD simulations. The\neffect is reliably reproduced in several independent computational experiments\nin different simulation conditions. With all major groove water removed,\nclosely similar results are obtained, with even better reproducibility. On the\nother hand, without explicit hydration, metastable dynamics around a B-DNA like\nstate can be obtained which, however, only poorly compares with experimental\ndata. It appears, therefore, that a right-handed DNA helix with explicitly\nhydrated minor groove is a minimal model system where the experimental\nproperties of B-DNA can be reproduced with non-trivial sequence-dependent\neffects. Its small size makes possible virtually exhaustive sampling, which is\na major advantage with respect to alternative approaches. An appendix is\nincluded with a correction to the implicit leapfrog integrator used in internal\ncoordinate MD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 1999 09:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
