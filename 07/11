In this respect\nthe state-dependence correlation functions and effective interactions which\nhave been produce by LOCV calculation with the Reid Soft Core and $\\Delta\n$-Reid interactions are used to estimate the size of higher order cluster terms\nsuch as the effect of three body cluster energy in nuclear matter. We find that\nthe three-body cluster energy is less than 1 MeV beyond the nuclear matter\nsaturation density and it has weaker density dependence than our previous\ncalculation with the state-averaged coorrelation functions and effective\ninteractions. Finally, we conclude that the LOCV method is good enough to\ncalculate other propertiesn of quantal fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 1999 07:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Single qubit gates are implemented\nusing quantum dots as phase shifters and electron waveguide couplers as beam\nsplitters. A Coulomb coupler acts as a 2-qubit gate, using a mutual phase\nmodulation effect. Since the electron phase coherence length in GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructures is of the order of 30$\\mu$m, several gates (tens) can be\nimplemented before the system decoheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 1999 00:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
