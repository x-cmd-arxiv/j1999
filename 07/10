The z ~ 2.8\npartial Lyman limit system towards QSO 0130-4021 provides the strongest\nevidence to date against large D/H ratios because the H I absorption, which\nconsists of a single high column density component with unsaturated high order\nLyman series lines, is readily modeled -- a task which is more complex in other\nD/H systems. We have obtained twenty-two hours of spectra from the HIRES\nspectrograph on the W.M. Keck telescope, which allow a detailed description of\nthe Hydrogen. We see excess absorption on the blue wing of the H I Lyman alpha\nline, near the expected position of Deuterium. However, we find that Deuterium\ncannot explain all of the excess absorption, and hence there must be\ncontamination by additional absorption, probably H I. This extra H I can\naccount for most or all of the absorption at the D position, and hence D/H = 0\nis allowed.

A new\ndiagnsotic tool is exploited to quantify how, over long times, different\nsegments of the same chaotic orbit can exhibit very different amounts of chaos.\nFirst passage time experiments are used to study how small perturbations of an\nindividual orbit can dramatically accelerate phase space transport, allowing\n`sticky' chaotic orbits trapped near regular islands to become unstuck on\nsuprisingly short time scales. Small perturbations are also studied in the\ncontext of orbit ensembles with the aim of understanding how such\nirregularities can increase the efficacy of chaotic mixing. For both noise and\nperiodic driving, the effect of the perturbation scales roughly in amplitude.\nFor white noise, the details are unimportant: additive and multiplicative noise\ntend to have similar effects and the presence or absence of a friction related\nto the noise by a Fluctuation- Dissipation Theorem is largely irrelevant.\nAllowing for coloured noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the\nperturbation, but only when the autocorrelation time, which vanishes for white\nnoise, becomes so large that t here is little power at frequencies comparable\nto the natural frequencies of the unperturbed orbit. This suggests strongly\nthat noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion associated\nwith periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon.

A simpler method\nconsists of extracting a finite set of templates from a sample of hand coded\nLTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method\nconsists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define\nhigher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of\ncorrespondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped\nonto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an\ninfinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created\nby parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the\ncorresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template.

First we show,\nfor the case where no fermions are included in the effective Lagrangian, that\nthe set of low-energy constants currently used in the literature is redundant.\nIn particular, by employing the equations of motion for the gauge fields one\ncan choose to remove two low-energy constants which contribute to the\nself-energies of the gauge bosons. If fermions are included in the effective\nfield theory analysis the situation is more involved. Even in this case,\nhowever, these contributions to the self-energies of the gauge bosons can be\nremoved. The relation of this result to the experimentally determined values\nfor the oblique parameters S, T, and U is discussed. In the second part of the\npaper we consider the matching relation between a full and an effective theory.\nWe show how the low-energy constants of the effective Lagrangian can be\ndetermined by matching gauge-invariant Green's functions in both theories. As\nan application we explicitly evaluate the low-energy constants for the standard\nmodel with a heavy Higgs boson.

The\noptical guide carries far blue-detuned light in the horizontally-polarized TE\nmode and far red-detuned light in the vertically-polarized TM mode, with both\nmodes close to optical cut-off. A trapping minimum in the transverse plane is\nformed above the optical guide due to the differing evanescent decay lengths of\nthe two modes. This design allows manufacture of mechanically stable\natom-optical elements on a substrate. We calculate the full vector bound modes\nfor an arbitrary guide shape using two-dimensional non-uniform finite elements\nin the frequency-domain, allowing us to optimize atom waveguide properties. We\nfind that a rectangular optical guide of 0.8um by 0.2um carrying 6mW of total\nlaser power (detuning +-15nm about the D2 line) gives a trap depth of 200uK for\ncesium atoms (m_F = 0), transverse oscillation frequencies of f_x = 40kHz and\nf_y = 160kHz, collection area ~ 1um^2 and coherence time of 9ms.
