The number of beneficial\nalleles in a multi-locus system can be considered a trait under exponential\nselection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait\ndistribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage\nequilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the\nproblem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution\ncumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional\nlinear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prugel-Bennett provides a closed\nform expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are\nshown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In\nparticular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation\ntheory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation\nrate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known\ndiffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or\nselection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of\ntime-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an\napproximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode.

Recent models of the galactic centre cluster's\ndensity and velocity distributions are used to calculate two-body collision\nrates. In particular we use stellar-evolution models to calculate the number of\ncollisions a star will have during different evolutionary phases. We find that\nthe number of two-body collisions per star is $\\lo 1$ in the central 0.1 to 0.2\npc, depending strongly on the galactocentric radius. Using a 3D numerical\nhydrodynamics code (SPH) we simulate encounters involving cluster stars of\nvarious masses with 2 and 8 solar-mass red giants. The instantaneous mass loss\nin such collisions is rarely enough to destroy either giant. A fraction of the\ncollisions do, however, lead to the formation of common envelope systems where\nthe impactor and giant's core are enshrouded by the envelope of the giant. Such\nsystems may evolve to expel the envelope, leaving a tight binary; the original\ngiant is destroyed. The fraction of collisions that produce common envelope\nsystems is sensitive to the local velocity dispersion and hence galactocentric\nradius.

The flows are assumed to be rotational and inviscid, and a new\ntechnique is described to determine the streamfunctions for linear shear\nprofiles. The geometries considered are the snow cornice and the\nbackward-facing step, whose edges allow for the separation of the flow and\nreattachment downstream of the recirculation regions. A point vortex has been\nadded to the flows in order to constrain the separation points to be located at\nthe edges, while the conformal mappings have been modified in order to smooth\nthe sharp edges and let the separation points be free to oscillate around the\npoints of maximum curvature. Unsteadiness is imposed on the flow by perturbing\nthe vortex location, either by displacing the vortex from equilibrium, or by\nimposing a random perturbation with zero mean on the vortex in equilibrium. The\ntrajectories of passive scalars continuously released upwind of the separation\npoint and trapped by the recirculating bubble are numerically integrated, and\nconcentration time series are calculated at fixed locations downwind of the\nreattachment points. This model proves to be capable of reproducing the\ntrapping and intermittent release of scalars, in agreement with the simulation\nof the flow past a snow cornice performed by a discrete multi-vortex model, as\nwell as with direct numerical simulations of the flow past a backward-facing\nstep. The simulation results indicate that for flows undergoing separation and\nreattachment the unsteadiness of the recirculating bubble is the main mechanism\nresponsible for the intense large-scale concentration fluctuations downstream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 1999 14:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The thin lens approximation\nis discussed quantitatively from a quantum perspective. Exact quantum\nexpressions for the Fourier components of the density (that include all\nspherical aberration) are used to study the focusing numerically. The following\nlens parameters and density profiles are calculated as functions of the pulsed\nfield area $\\theta $: the position of the focal plane, peak atomic density,\natomic density pattern at the focus, focal spot size, depth of focus, and\nbackground density. The lens parameters are compared to asymptotic, analytical\nresults derived from a scalar diffraction theory for which spherical aberration\nis small but non-negligible ($\\theta \\gg 1$). Within the diffraction theory\nanalytical expressions show that the focused atoms in the far detuned case have\nan approximately constant background density $0.5(1-0.635\\theta ^{- 1/2})$\nwhile the peak density behaves as $% 3.83\\theta ^{1/2}$, the focal distance or\ntime as $\\theta ^{-1}(1+1.27\\theta ^{- 1/2})$, the focal spot size as\n$0.744\\theta ^{-3/4}$, and the depth of focus as $1.91\\theta ^{- 3/2}$.\nFocusing by the resonant standing wave field leads to a new effect, a Rabi-\nlike oscillation of the atom density. For the far-detuned lens, chromatic\naberration is studied with the exact Fourier results. Similarly, the\ndegradation of the focus that results from angular divergence in beams or\nthermal velocity distributions in traps is studied quantitatively with the\nexact Fourier method and understood analytically using the asymptotic results.\nOverall, we show that strong thin lens focusing is possible with modest laser\npowers and with currently achievable atomic beam characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 1999 19:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
